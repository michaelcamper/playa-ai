We’re about to find out, in the thrilling first installment of MOOP Map Live 2012!\n\nDay One of Playa Restoration was a day of legend, the perfect day. Maybe, just maybe the Best Day Ever.\n\nA lot of that is thanks to YOU, all you MOOP maniacs who cleaned up after yourselves and your neighbors too.\n\nSome of it is thanks to the weather: A clear, 90° day with a light breeze. Warm, but not deathly hot — and nary a dust storm to be seen.\n\nFor the rest, we can thank the all-star Playa Restoration team, who covered a record 96 blocks in a single day, beating the previous record by 30! That’s unheard of, folks. Let’s give ’em a big round of applause!\n\nYes, on their very first day this team has proved their mettle — but they couldn’t have done it without the help of the Burning Man community. Remember, the MOOP Map isn’t about us: It’s about YOU. This is YOUR scorecard, Black Rock City, and without further ado, here are your first day’s results:\n\nWow! It sure is easy to cover 96 blocks when there’s hardly any MOOP to pick up! Great job, Black Rock City. With the exception of a few pesky yellow and red spots, you left the entire expanse from 2:00 to 10:00, between Iris and Lilac, a beautiful swath of Go-Go-GREEN!\n\nWell done, Playa Restoration, and well done YOU at home. Tune in tomorrow to find out how the Esplanade fared …\n\nTil then, this is The Hun signing off.\n\nPhotos by Vertumnus!",
