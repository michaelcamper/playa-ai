This chapter in the adventure takes us through Europe searching out the Euro Burners and finding new Regional Contacts to put our growing Regional Network on the map in several new countries. First stop – Paris, France. Here I caught up with the Paris Regional Contacts Eddy, Marc and Philippe.\n\nThese three have been working hard since Nowhere to create and bring their local community together in Paris. One of the things they have stared is a monthly gathering in Paris akin to the Burning Pub in London only theirs is called Burning Cafe. To get in touch with the Parisian RCs you can send them an email to: paris(at)burningman(dot)com. Alas, I missed the monthly gathering in Paris by a few hours due to a delayed flight and lost luggage. As they say here, c’est la vie and I hope to catch up with them again in January for the next Burning Cafe.\n\nFor info on all the current happenings in Paris, be sure to check out their site – www.frenchburners.org and paris-announce0subscribe@burningman.com\n\nOnce you join the site, you will receive the monthly newsletter that lets you know about current events in Paris and around Europe. A must for any French speaking burners who live here or are passing through Paris.\n\nWhile I missed Burning Cafe, I DID however manage to make it to a soiree in Brussels of epic proportions. Our new RC in Belgium, Charly organized a party for the French speaking website parano.be\n\nCharly our new Regional Contact in Belgium: belgium(at)burningman(dot)com\n\nHeld in the former slaughterhouse caves underneath the largest and oldest open air market in Europe, over 2700 participants came together for an evening very much in the Burning Man spirit. The site (very similar to tribe.net) allows people to pick a secteur (tribe). The night of the party, each secteur represented itself in a vault within the caves. The MTL (metal heads), the GOT (goths), PKR (poker fans), ART (artists), etc all came together and interacted and met with each other.\n\nThere was even a Burning Man secteur created for people to stop by and visit, ask questions, say hello and learn about that little thing we do in the desert. At all times of the evening, the BM secteur was full of people browsing books and Newsletters, photos and enjoying a relaxing time in the little chill lounge that we built. I was amazed at the similarities in participation and community. Everyone was at ease, meeting new friends, visiting old and bringing something creative to the table. The interest in Burning Man was definitely high as many had heard about it but never had the chance to attend.\n\nThe Burning Man secteur and special friends from England – Vanessa, Zooty and Zero!\n\nNot only did everyone participate but Leave No Trace was very much in full effect. The following day as everyone sleepily showed up to tear down and pack up I was thrilled to see that each secteur carefully removed all traces of the night before. Sweeping up MOOP on the floor, peeling the tape from the walls. There was no doubt that even without being an official BM event, the same spirit and principles that we hold so dear were very much at the surface and in practice underneath the city of Brussels for one magical evening. Benoit put on a glow show on the dance floor. Fire was not permitted in the caves.\n\nNot only do we have new RCs in Paris and Belgium but also in French speaking Geneva, Switzerland where Nathanael Gloor has stepped up to represent and help keep the fires burning year round en Suisse. You can reach him: geneva(at)burningman(dot)com\n\nBienvenue to our new French speaking Regionals!",
