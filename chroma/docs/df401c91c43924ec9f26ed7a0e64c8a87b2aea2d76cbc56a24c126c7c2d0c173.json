Hawkins Foundation, Reno Burners LLC, and the Black Rock Arts Foundation.\n\nThe Black Rock Arts Foundation thanks the following people, businesses and organizations for their generous support of Tree Spire:\n\nAND to the Artists that made it happen: Tabasco Mills, T-Bone, Dave and the Iron Monkeys!\n\nThe Iron Monkeys are a Seattle-based metalworking collective, working under the gentle guidance and watchful eye of Tabasco Mills, owner of Seattle’s The Blacksmith Shop www.theblacksmithshop.com/ironmonkeys.html .\n\nThey work together creating large-scale sculptural pieces, often containing functional elements, and work collaboratively to evolve designs as each work is being developed.  Their work has been on display temporarily in Black Rock City at the Burning Man event, Reno Mangrove, Burien Interim Arts Space, and permanently at Rainier Vista’s Central Park in South Seattle, Washington and now in Whitaker Park, in northwest Reno, Nevada.\n\nFor more information on other activities of the Black Rock Arts Foundation – www.blackrockarts.org",
