  "content": "No doubt it’s important to read. The right books can help us understand the world a little better, create empathy and compassion, and let our minds fly freely.\n\nBut what are some good reads for Burners, specifically?\n\nWith hopes of some serious mind-expansion in 2017, we posed this question to the Burning Man community: that is, what book would you recommend that relates to the 10 Principles and why? Over 40 other people chimed in with their picks, with Eckhart Tolle titles getting almost 10% of the nods from Burners who wrote in.\n\nFor those with scholarly leanings, there’s also the Burning Academics page, which points to a wealth of academic writing about Burning Man, plus the Burning Nerds group, a networking hub for researchers and thinkers in sociology, anthropology, architecture, art, economics, spirituality and other disciplines.\n\nSuffice it to say, we now have our reading cut out for the year, and we hope you do, too. If you would like to suggest a book for a follow up post with more recommendations, submit your pick via this form and tell us why it’s important to you. We’d love for this to be an ongoing feature for hungry minds.\n\nThe Gift\n\nLewis Hyde\n\nThe Power of Now\n\nEckhart Tolle\n\nThe Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\n\nAlan Watts\n\nBig Magic\n\nElizabeth Gilbert\n\nReligion for Atheists\n\nAlain de Botton\n\nThe Four Agreements\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz\n\nTemporary Autonomous Zone\n\nHakim Bey\n\nThe Tao of Pooh\n\nBenjamin Hoff\n\nThe Tao of Bill Murray\n\nGavin Edwards\n\nA Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster\n\nRebecca Solnit\n\nNonviolent Communication\n\nMarshall Rosenberg\n\nSOULCRAFT: Crossing into the Mysteries of Nature and Psyche\n\nBill Plotkin\n\nThe Alchemist\n\nPaulo Coelho\n\nThe Big Orange Splot\n\nDaniel Pinkwater\n\nCat’s Cradle\n\nKurt Vonnegut\n\nMars Trilogy\n\nKim Stanley Robinson\n\nSiddhartha\n\nHerman Hesse\n\nDune\n\nFrank Herbert\n\nMeditation in Action\n\nChöygam Trungpa\n\nOn Celtic Tides\n\nChris Duff\n\nRadical Self-Acceptance\n\nTara Brach\n\nA New Earth\n\nEckhart Tolle\n\nPronoia\n\nRob Breszny\n\n1984\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\nThe Man Burns Tonight: A Black Rock City Mystery\n\nDonn Cortez\n\nNonviolent Soldier of Islam: Badshah Khan\n\nEknath Easwaran\n\nIshmael\n\nDaniel Quinn\n\nBrave New World\n\nAldous Huxley\n\nNeon Fever Dream\n\nEliot Peper\n\nSneaky Cards Play It Forward\n\nGameWright\n\n(Top photo: Library of Babel by Warrick Macmillan, photo by Alena Bolshakova)",
