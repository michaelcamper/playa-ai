  "content": "It’s less than a week until The Artumnal Gathering, and we can’t wait to share another amazing event with you all — except that it’s not just one event this year. It’s three!\n\nWe are expanding our 12th Artumnal Gathering to include new festivities on November 17 in San Francisco, so if you haven’t nabbed your time-travelling ticket yet, check out the great events below.\n\nThe Artumnal Gathering is Burning Man Project’s annual fundraiser for our Art and Civic Engagement programs, which help support art on and off playa and bring Burning Man culture to the world.\n\nThe success of this fundraiser depends on the generosity of our community, and we’re also still seeking volunteers for the Time(less) Dinner and Auction.\n\nThis year’s theme invites you to step into a time(less) array of experiences and a kaleidoscope of human expression, participation and flow-state. We will celebrate all golden eras of art, ideas and culture, as we contemplate the possibilities of our illustrious future and how we will connect in 100, 200, 300 years.\n\nWhat parts of community, revelry and ritual will still be with us in the coming millennia as we overcome the problems that divide us today? What will be the great challenges of our time? And how will we dance and dress, for goodness’ sake?\n\nBlack Rock Roller Disco Time Warp\n11:00 am–2:00 pm\nChurch of Eight Wheels, 554 Fillmore St, San Francisco\nTickets: $10+\n\nArtumnal Gathering Future Formal Celebration, presented by Airpusher Collective\n8:00 pm–4:00 am\n550 Barneveld Avenue, San Francisco\nTickets: $40+\n\nThe Artumnal Gathering Time(less) Machine Dinner and Auction\n5:00 pm–12:00 midnight\nTerra Gallery, 511 Harrison Street, San Francisco\nTickets: $500+\n\nThank you to Airpusher Collective, Black Rock Roller Disco and all the artists, performers, volunteers and auction donors that make these events possible.
