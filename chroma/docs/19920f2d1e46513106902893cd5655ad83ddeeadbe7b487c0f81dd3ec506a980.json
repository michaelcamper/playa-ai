  "content": "A mountain biking friend and I started our no-nonsense playa bike repair in 2009. We figured we’d help Burners out by repairing a few flat tires. Little did we know that it would be so popular! After five or so years of camping solo, we formed Camp Brewhaha. We’re a no bullshit, fiercely independent cast of characters who have somehow managed to coexist for the past seven or eight years.\n\nAfter more than 10 years of doing bike repair at Burning Man, I have decided that perhaps it’s time to try a little preventative maintenance. And so, I’m giving you all a little pre-BRC bike advice in an effort to make you more self-sufficient and reduce our workload.\n\nPlaya Bike Tips for Anyone Headed to BRC\n\nPeeps — trust me, your bike will save your Burn! Yes you need water, food and shelter. But without a bike, your Burn is going to be a lot less enjoyable!\n\nPlaya Bike Dos and Don’ts\n\nFinally, do ride your bike as much as possible before the burn. This will get your ass accustomed to being in the saddle and give you a feel for how comfortable the bike is, so you can make any adjustments before the Burn and not have to do it while you’re there.\n\nChecklist for an Ideal Playa Bike\n\nI am a firm believer in the KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) principle for anything I do in Black Rock City. So for me, the ideal bike is as simple as possible:\n\nChecklist for Bike Supplies to Bring to BRC\n\nNote: Before attempting any bike repairs or Magic Juicing on the playa, please ensure you put down a tarp or something to protect the playa and collect any MOOP that may fall off your bike.\n\nMy Recipe for Magic Juice Playa Bike Lube\n\nIf you choose to ignore all of this sage advice, at the very least make yourself a spray bottle of Magic Juice and bring it along. After 10 years of trying every kind of bike lube imaginable with limited success combating the devastating impact of playa dust on a bike, the only thing that truly works is our tried and true Magic Juice. It is simple but very effective at removing playa dust and applying a very thin lubricant that will not attract playa dust.\n\nMagic Juice Recipe: Mix ¼ cup of baby oil or mineral oil with 4 cups of white vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray all the moving parts of your bike with this daily and watch the magic happen.\n\nNote: Magic juice is only meant to be used on the playa to get you through the Burn. Don’t use it on your bike when you get back home!\n\nThe one skill you can learn, pre-playa, to make sure your bike doesn’t break:\n\nOptimal lighting for a playa bike:\n\nThere are so many light systems out there, but the most important thing in my mind is that you are visible from all four sides. So for example, lights on your wheels alone are only visible from the side, not from the front and back. Likewise, a light that’s only on the front of your bike is only visible from the front.",
