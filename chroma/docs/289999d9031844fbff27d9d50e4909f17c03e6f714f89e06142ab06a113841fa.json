  "content": "Large-scale, interactive, collaboratively created artworks are gaining more and more attention, which brings great joy to those of us who have been building, funding, experiencing, and burning ‘Burning Man style’ art for many years.\n\nIn our ongoing efforts to share the Burning Man ethos beyond the borders of Black Rock City, we are pleased to be in collaboration with two museums that will feature the work of artists from within the Burning Man community over the next couple of years:  The Hermitage Museum in Norfolk, VA, and the Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum, in Washington, D.C. (yup, you read that right. The Smithsonian. Stay tuned for more info on that exciting development). Also worth noting, Christine Kristen, LadyBee, will be exhibiting her Jewelry of Burning Man at the Fuller Craft Museum in Boston this spring.\n\nThe Hermitage Museum exhibit will open June 4, 2017, and features the work of Five Ton Crane, Michael Garlington and Natalia Bertotti, Gregg Fleishman, Charles Gadeken, Jim Peterson, and Kirsten Berg. True to the spirit of Burning Man, the museum’s Director, Jen Duncan is actively engaged in creating both a substantial exhibit experience and a volunteer participation experience that can include becoming involved with the installation of the work and hosting the exhibition for Burners who want to become “docents” during the exhibit which will run for five months.\n\nDuring a kick-off event to engage the community in planning for the exhibit, this Thursday, January 12, Burning Man co-founder Crimson Rose and art logistics coordinator Brody Scotland will be presenting “The Art of Burning Man” to a packed house at the Hermitage Museum and Gardens in Norfolk, Virginia, followed by networking time for Burners and Burn-curious people in the area.\n\nThe Hermitage Museum is a gorgeous place with a history of eclectic taste. We’re honored to be joining the conversation there, and collaborating on this exciting project.\n\nCheck out the coverage in the local paper, the Virginian-Pilot. This week’s event is full, but it sounds like the hosts will be posting follow-ups and updates on the Facebook event page, and of course there will be plenty of time to check out the actual exhibit between June and October of this year.\n\nWe’re thrilled about these opportunities to share Burning Man culture with the wider world, and to shine a brighter spotlight on Burning Man artists who have created pieces for Black Rock City that have been delighting participants year after dusty year. We’re especially keen for those who may never set foot on the Black Rock Desert to have a chance to explore and experience Burning Man art for themselves.\n\n(Top photo courtesy of the Hermitage Museum and Gardens.
