  "content": "I was, I saw a Queen in a golden bathtub and\nCleopatra’s slaves hauled her through the desert in\nthat labour of love, plastic palms and spraypaint.\n\nI saw, I was a Vegas showgirl, red and black feathers,\nsequins, jewels, fishnets flapping in the hot, hot\ndesert wind. Can-cans and cocktails all class.\n\nI saw, I was, a bleached blonde, frightened, sick girl\nholding my love, being held, supporting supported\nnothing we won’t survive. I am there for you.\n\nI was, I saw, twisted in the brain, running holding\nhands through the desert dust full moon shine chasing\nthat dragon, Planet Earth fading into the background.\n\nI saw, I was Nursing a hangover, stethoscope, white\nuniform, hands stained red with your hair, art\ntigerstripes coral pink, your streaks echo the\nlandscape and plagiarize the sunset.\n\nI was, I saw, a temple of tears we all cried. Nothing\nwe won’t survive.\n\nIt’s dirty in a good way, baby.\n\nby Nurse Wasabi",
