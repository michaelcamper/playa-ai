  "content": "“Truth is Beauty”, the sculpture created by Marco Cochrane was probably one of the most talked about and beautiful sculptures and was recognisable from anywhere on the playa. The second in the trilogy by the renowned sculptor, most commonly referred to as the “Dancing Lady”, presented me with my first Burgin “playa moment”.\n\nAs I approached the statue after photographing from afar, I noticed the inscriptions on the plinth. As I squatted down to read the text, a Mutant Vehicle passed and some yobbos yelled out,\n\n“Nice arse! Show us your tits!”\n\nI immediately burst into tears and was sobbing.\n\nI tried to pull myself together as I walked back to my bike but an approaching woman saw my red eyes and asked, “What’s wrong honey?”\n“The statue”, I blubbered.\n“Yes, it is so beautiful”, she responded.\n“It is beautiful yes, but that’s not why I’m crying. It’s the inscription on the plinth”.\n“What does it say?”\nI led her over, we both crouched down, “What would the world be like if women were safe?”\nAnd with that we both began sobbing and rode out the emotion by hugging it out together.\n\nby Kevin “Kabi” Rigby AKA “Outfit”",
