  "content": "That moment when you’re leaning against the railing of some art car, dazed, head lolling to the music. It’s chilly and late, and you wonder if your night is over. Then again, it isn’t up to you. It’s up to the driver of this mutant vehicle, and she doesn’t seem to be very interested in the 3 o’clock plaza, your corridor back to camp. Your fellow Burner pokes you in the ribs.\n\n“Wake up!” he insists.\n\n“I’m awake,” you concede.\n\n***\n\nThe moment a passer-by smiles at you from underneath a carved, wooden wild boar mask with broken, black tusks.\n\n***\n\nThe moment the man stands up in the sweat hut, as naked as everyone, and starts singing “Hey Jude.” You wonder what his job is in the default world.\n\n***\n\nThe moment you slice your knuckle with the dull multi-tool trying to punch the last hole in the last tennis ball to cover the last stake, setting up your tent on the first day.\n\nYou would have been done, ready, finally at home, but now you’re washing blood and playa off your hand, opening last year’s dusty first aid kit, swabbing with alcohol, wrapping a bandage, and laughing at yourself.\n\n***\n\nWhen I remember Burning Man, the memories never arise in any particular order. Some smell or photograph or garment on the closet floor will send me backward through time to some precise moment in the middle of a week in the desert.\n\nThose memories don’t seem to lose their vividness. They all feel like little stories, not just dry recollections of facts or events. They’re different from default-world memories.\n\nWhat if we could see our everyday experiences as little stories like that?\n\n***\n\nThe moment you recoil in horror, rounding a corner in some dark camp in the middle of nowhere, following macabre, crackling jazz, and seared into your memory forever are the unending gyrations of two disgusting, freak-show shadow puppets copulating like pornographic devils, driven by some infernal piston.\n\nOnly later that night does it become the funniest thing that has ever happened to you.\n\n***\n\nThat moment when you’re just walking the Esplanade at night, minding your own business, when the whole horizon lights up and a fireball unfurls into the sky, and you realize that an artful structure that was a playground to you only yesterday has just been immolated by its creators.\n\n***\n\nThe moment you and the person with whom you’ve been sitting for hours, hiding out from a nasty dust storm, realize you don’t know each other’s names.\n\n***\n\nThat moment, late in the afternoon, when the tires hit paved road on 447 after idling in the dust all day long, and you realize you’re leaving, it’s over, and you’re going back.\n\nAnd an hour later, you lock eyes with the gas station attendant and wonder what in the world he sees.\n\n***\n\nWhat moments do you remember best?",
