  "content": "Next Door to Forever\n\nIt is the greatest spectacle I’ve never seen.\nThe grandest celebration I never attended.\nThe most ecstatic, uplifting, mind-altering, ego-shattering,\nSoul-connecting experience I’ve never participated in, ever.\nIt is Burning Man.\nIn another year or so, I will find my way back in the desert to a place I’ve never been.\nAnd I will greet the people I have always known, and never met.\nI will find ways to give back to each of you who have given so very much to me, a perfect stranger; family.\nI think it must call to us, the way the ocean calls to some, or the mountains.\nI think it is a beacon of sorts; broadcasting on the silent, iconoclastic, superconductive wavelength of the heart.\nAn outsider, I will find next year that place of recognition and remembrance, where even the intolerable are tolerated, the excluded come to shelter others, and the dying breathe life into the living.\nHere, the profane is mixed in equal portions with the glorious and the sublime; the ridiculous and the reverent.\nHere, we come to be human.\nWe will bring with us our hopes and our fears, our dreams and longings; desires and insecurities, creativity and frustration; our heartache, sorrow, and our joy. And in return we will accept what the Playa offers us, with gratitude, if not always understanding.\nWho can describe the sound of a tear on a child’s cheek?\nWhat is it to wake up, knowing you are truly alive?\nIt will be enough.\nIt always is.\nFor a single week, we will once more embrace what it is like to live next door to forever.\nAs strangers, we will find our way home.\nWith open arms, we will welcome us in.\n\nby Sonnivhek",
