  "content": "Download the entire zip file or get individual MP3s now at the new Art Installations Audio Tours page.\n\nThe MP3s are great to listen to while packing, on the drive to BRC, or on playa, as you’ll have your own personal art tour guide. They should import into your music player as an album and are easy to drop into a playlist.\n\nYour tour guides are the ever fantastic art fanatics  Jim Tierney and Evonne Heyning. Blurbs for each piece are written by Jim Tierney  or the individual artists.\n\nSpread the word far and wide and bring your own Art tour to the playa.\n\nAlso, the ARTery has created a page devoted to everything you need to know about  Art Tours in Black Rock City this year\n\nEnjoy!",
