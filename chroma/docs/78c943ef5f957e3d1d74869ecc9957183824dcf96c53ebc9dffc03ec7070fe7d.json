Get involved with this great Black Rock Arts Foundation grantee project and help make it happen! It will be in New York, Black Rock City, San Francisco and Los Angeles, SOON. You know you want to, so make it happen!\n\nMobule is a kinetic, multi-media, mobile, interactive street art performance that connects people from different cities. Check out theses videos about Mobule on the project’s website: http://www.mobule.org/\n\nThe artist, Ludale, needs 3 partners for each performance. It’s really easy to help! All you do is:\n\n– Invite people to participate in an interactive game (invite them to try on the ‘space helmet’ and control the Mobule. Who doesn’t want to wear a space helmet?!?)\n– Interview people\n– Help video the interviews\n– Help pack up the Mobule after the show\n\nDon’t one of those roles sound just like something you could do?\n\nHere are the dates the Mobule needs help. All performances are 9:00 pm – 11:00 pm:\n\nMonday, August 15th\nTuesday August 16th\nBrooklyn Bridge park – New York.\n\nFriday, August 19th\nPier 14, Near the Raygun Gothic Rocketship, by the Ferry building – San Francisco.\n\nSaturday 20th, August 20th\nMission Delores Park – San Francisco.\n\nAugust, 29th – September 4th\nCenter Camp – Black Rock City.\n\nFriday, September 9th and Saturday 10th\nSanta Monica Pier – Los Angeles.\n\nArtist Ludale and the Mobule also need places to stay during their travels, and need a ride to and from Burning Man any day between 8/23 and 8/28!\n\nCan you help?
