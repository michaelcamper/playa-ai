  "content": "We are excited to announce the call for alcove art for the Multiverse Man Base, which will feature four external alcoves and four internal alcoves. We look forward to receiving your ideas and collaborating with you as we prepare to journey to the Multiverse!\n\nThe Idea\n\nA multiverse may be the coexistence of multiple universes separated by space, time, or dimension. We may exist in one, some, or all of these simultaneously; however, we continue to find ourselves at the center of that which we call our general reality. When we look beyond what we know about this reality, perhaps to find something larger than ourselves, we can’t help but also seek to find humanity in the vastness of this expanding all.\n\nThe 2020 Man Base wood structure represents five bubble universes held in suspended animation at the center of the Burning Man Multiverse. Four entry portals form connections like cosmic wormholes, and reveal the interstitial Space that is holding all possible futures and realities in the quantum constellation.\n\nWhat will you contribute to the experience of the Multiverse? Send us your wildly imagined ways to engage and transport humans and other colliding life forms through your visions of teleportation or telekinesis as we explore the expressive possibilities of an unfolding reality.\n\nExternal Alcoves\n\nBring us your kinetic, wind-inspired, suspended works of art. Planetary references, Calder-esque mobiles, intergalactic thermal measuring gizmos, pendants of spectacularity, suspended animation in sublime formats welcome.\n\nThere will be four external alcoves, located in the corners of the Man Base at 1:30, 4:30, 7:30, and 10:30. We may select four separate designs and design teams for each external alcove, or we may select fewer design teams with a vision that utilizes multiple spaces.\n\nFor each external alcove sculpture, we will grant $2,500 for materials and transportation. Each team will also receive early access to the Black Rock City for installation and the event.\n\nPhysical Constraints\n\nEach external alcove will be framed by the outside edges of the Man Base’s large arches. Your hanging art piece should fit within these specifications:\n\nYour piece will hang from up to five points above the installation location. These points create the four corners of a box and the center point. We will provide you with an “eye” in each of these points, and you should provide a rated carabiner or quick-link connection, and appropriate aircraft cabling with crimped or crosby connections to your artwork.\n\nFrom the bottom of your piece, connect to a centrally located ground anchor with aircraft cable (to prevent the wind from bashing your art piece against the Man Base).\n\nArtists should consider reasonable means to secure their pieces against tampering. Consider things like concealed access panels, etc.\n\nLighting\n\nYour piece will be externally lit for night-time viewing. You may additionally include battery-powered LED lighting on your piece. Be sure to design the battery access where you can reach it from the ground.\n\nInternal Alcoves\n\nAnimate our alcoves as portals and time-traveling machines — what contraptions, mind-altering options, and systems for teleportation might be created within the corners of our Multiverse station?\n\nThere will be four internal alcoves, located in the interior of the Man Base at 1:30, 4:30, 7:30, and 10:30. We may select four separate designs and design teams for each internal alcove, or we may select fewer design teams with a vision that utilizes multiple spaces.\n\nFor each internal alcove installation, we will grant $4,000 for materials and transportation. Each team will also receive early access to the Black Rock City for installation and the event.\n\nThe lavender-shaded space in the image shows the footprint of space available for the placement of internal alcove art:\n\nYour alcove art installation should be freestanding and self-supporting within the allocated space. We would like to avoid very small passageways or dead-end spaces both inside of your piece and between your piece and the rest of the structure. Please design with that in mind.\n\nYou should plan to bring the pieces of your installation through the tunnels, which are about 9ft in height and 18ft in width at their narrowest point. Heavy equipment may not be available to assist in transporting pieces into the interior of the Man Base; we are evaluating the logistics needed. If an alternative is not pre-arranged, please be prepared to hand-carry the pieces for assembly on the inside.\n\nArtists should consider reasonable means to secure their pieces against tampering. Consider things like concealed access panels, etc.\n\nLighting and Electrical\n\nThe Man Base team can provide your Internal Alcove installation with electricity to power lighting circuits. We can’t support large draws like motors, but we can support your low-draw (preferably LED) lighting.\n\nEach internal alcove will have a single quad-receptacle box installed at ground level from which you can run power distribution to your elements, but we are open to supporting your other needs. Please ask in your proposal.\n\nPlease plan to bury electrical extension cords. It’s best if you have something in your design that hides the quad box so we don’t find people unplugging your lighting to charge their cell phones (just a little experience on the matter).\n\nIn terms of an overall complimentary lighting scheme, we are still evolving our lighting design plan, so it would be helpful to describe your ideas for lighting color and temperature. Use of simple lighting plans with tones of amber can be the simplest to integrate while providing a sense of warmth for your experience. If you have a more specific lighting plan that includes color, we will need to review and approve it early in the process.\n\nSet-Up and Strike\n\nOther Stuff that Might Be Useful to Know\n\nPre-event, on-site set-up:\n\nDuring the event:\n\nContracts and Plans\n\nBurning Man Project will contract and coordinate the selected proposals. The selected designers will need to participate in pre-installation logistics meetings and provide drawings, sketches and specifications to our team as needed. We understand that the proposed project may slightly evolve during the finalization of the design and build plan. If your plans change significantly from what you propose, we’ll need to work with you to review and approve the changes.\n\nProject Timeline\n\nIf you have questions while creating your submission, you may email them to shing.kong@burningman.org. We’ll update this blog post with relevant Q&A’s.\n\nProposals are due on April 21, 2020 at 11:59 pm Pacific Time. Once we have selected the proposals, we will issue a contract and begin work on nailing down installation plans.\n\nThe Man Base opens on Sunday, August 30. Your piece must be fully installed and your installation debris removed from the site no later than 9am on Sunday, August 30.\n\nEvaluation and Award Process\n\nThe team reviewing your submissions will include creative types in the Art Department along with members of the Man Base crew. The creative team will evaluate proposals based on adherence to the request, creativity, visual appeal, and feasibility.\n\nSubmission Details\n\nThe proposal form includes a range of questions about your basic contact information, and details of your experience and project.
