  "content": "I was wrong.\nI used to think that Regional Burning Man events were a sort of “farm league” or practice ground for people who were not ready to commit to the Big Burn in Nevada. But a recent adventure to participate in Blazing Swan in Western Australia proved to me that the regional system WORKS.\n\nBurning Man is not scalable if everyone needs to visit Black Rock City. But I am now inspired and encouraged knowing that Regional Events and global communities practicing the 10 Principles have the same power to change lives and change the world as the Big Burn. I now know I can travel anywhere around the world…and be welcomed Home.\n\nMusic Video Peek at Blazing Swan:",
