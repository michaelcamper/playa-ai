BRAF is currently requesting proposals from San Francisco Bay Area artists for the Composting Contraption.com·post [k?mp?st] is a combination of various decaying organic substances that are being decomposed largely through aerobic decomposition into a rich black soil.\n\ncon·trap·tion [kuhn-trap-shuhn] – a mechanical contrivance; gadget; device.\n\nImagine inventor Rube Goldberg meeting up with biodynamic farming pioneer Rudolf Steiner.\n\nThe Composting Contraption will be a human-powered, interactive, kinetic artwork designed to inspire, motivate and educate San Francisco residents to increase the practice of composting at home and to take better advantage of the City’s green bin organics collection programs serving the residential, commercial, and institutional sectors.\n\nThis new work of art will travel to local festivals, street fairs, farmers markets and schools to increase awareness of composting (and recycling to some extent) and change the composting behavior of San Francisco artists and residents to divert recoverable resources from being disposed of as solid waste, in keeping with the City’s zero waste goals. The artist is not expected to bring the contraption all around town, but will work with a local community group to train them on its use so they can tour it around in an educational campaign.\n\nMaterials used for this new mobile sculpture MUST primarily be made of reclaimed, recycled or reused materials diverted from local landfills.\n\nFor more information about how to apply!",
