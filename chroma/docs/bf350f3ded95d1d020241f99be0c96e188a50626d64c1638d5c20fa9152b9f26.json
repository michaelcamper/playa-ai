  "content": "You can do almost anything you want at Burning Man. But there are some important don’ts.\n\nLike, “Don’t shine lasers at people’s eyes.”\n\nSeriously.\n\nRanger Halston was permanently blinded in her left eye at last year’s burn.\n\nThat is WAY too much to give up.\n\nAnd now she has mounting doctors fees and lost wages.\n\n“It’s all fun and games until…”\n\nI like to think that If I accidentally drop my scarf on the playa, a fellow burner will pick it up.\n\nThat if I am thirsty in deep playa, a fellow burner will give me water.\n\nThat if I hurt my leg on rebar, a fellow burner will help me back to camp.\n\nAnd if I damage my sight while serving as a Ranger, fellow burners will help me out.\n\nIf you can, please gift to her fundraiser.\n\nUPDATE:  Will Chase has posted a more in depth look at Ranger Halston’s situation.",
