  "content": "Would you like to have some snappies from Burning Man? Are you worried about ruining your “good” camera? Then keep it safe at home, or keep wrapped up in a plastic baggie, and use the camera you have with you — your phone.\n\nHere are some pics from around and about over the past week. They were all taken (and edited) with the phone.\n\n(And just for a second we’ll leave aside discussions of whether to take pics at all, what to take pictures of, and what you’ll do with them later. … They’re all good and worthy discussions, but let’s put them on hold for just a little bit.)",
