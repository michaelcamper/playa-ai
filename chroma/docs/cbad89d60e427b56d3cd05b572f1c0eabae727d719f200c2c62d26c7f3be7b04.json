  "content": "We are pleased to announce that the door is now open for your creative contribution to this year’s Man Pavilion. This year we are excited to announce two artist calls. You’ll find detailed information on the design call-out in this post, and you can find out more about the call for performers over here. We look forward to receiving your ideas and collaborating with you on another epic Burning Man event in Black Rock City!\n\nThe Idea\n\nEach year we contemplate the structure and site for the Man as a place of interaction, invitation and, for some, a symbolic annual trek to the middle of Black Rock City. With our entire urban plan built around this iconic figure at the heart of the playa, the Man Pavilion is, after a fashion, our central ‘monument’.\n\nOf course, we lovingly burn our monument each year, which is such a wonderful ritual of not taking ourselves too seriously, holding on too tightly, or over deifying our public symbol. It is both a rich and richly ironic statement of our constancy and our impermanence.\n\nTo create the interactive experience at this year’s Man Pavilion, we are seeking design teams, urbanists, artists and architects to generate places for participants to gather and to activate the surrounding environment of the Man base.\n\nThe first is a civic design challenge inspired by the theme Metamorphoses and the need to change our approach to the built environment. We are seeking innovative ways to encourage a community to be in one place together, as well as ideas that can be potentially translated from Black Rock City into global urban settings.\n\nWe are asking artists and designers to join us in considering what it means to be a city, Black Rock City, with an emphasis on the way urban spaces and buildings can either create disconnection or foster social connectivity. This challenge speaks to how we shape experience, encourage frivolity and fun, celebrate artistic approaches to public places, and stimulate interaction among people through design choices.\n\nWe are looking to select projects that evoke a plaza or park, which are thoughtful in terms of both the location and this year’s theme. Thought should be given to seating, artwork, design, and other elements that are conducive to a central place of assembly.\n\nEach of the three selected projects will receive a stipend of $10,000 for materials and transportation, access to gift Burning Man 2019 tickets for your team, and Work Access Passes for early site entry and installation. All installation should be complete by 9 am Sunday, August 25. For inspiration regarding the theme, see the 2019 theme announcement.\n\nPhysical Constraints\n\nCreative Urban Design spaces will include three separate ‘parklets’ close to the Man. We may allocate these spaces to three separate designers, or we may potentially grant them to one design team with a vision that utilizes all three spaces.\n\nThe spaces will be approximately 4,700 square feet with their inboard boundary at a radius of approximately 95 feet from the center of the Man Pavilion and an outboard boundary of 145 feet radius. The space will have an inboard frontage of approximately 73 linear feet and an outboard border of approximately 111 feet. The spaces will be defined at the 9 o’clock, 12 o’clock and 3 o’clock positions around the Man and are shown here, shaded.\n\nThe corner of each space will be indicated by bike racks and thematic, free-standing lighting elements (we call them Opa Lights) that will tie the entire Pavilion together visually.\n\nWhile not required in the proposal stage, if your proposed area includes structures larger than benches, we may ask for details listed under Building Safe Structures on our website. Shade structures will need to be evaluated in a similar manner, but fear not, we’re here to help.\n\nOut here in the wide open spaces around the Man, the winds are even more vicious than in residential Black Rock City. Additionally, shade structures cannot impede the sightlines from the city to the Man Pavilion. We think a good guideline for height is to consider ‘people scale’ and that shade much higher than 10’ creates both a wonderful sail (not great), and ends up throwing shade outside of its footprint about as much as it does inside.\n\nLighting and Electrical\n\nThe Man Build team can provide you with electricity to power lighting circuits. Due to distance and distribution, we can’t support large draws like motors, but we can support your low draw (preferably LED) lighting. Please include a plan to light each element you install to ensure it is safe for pedestrians and the occasional errant bicyclist within the Pavilion area.\n\nWhile Mutant Vehicles viewing your installation aren’t a concern within the Man Pavilion, there is good information about things to consider for lighting on our website. Solar is a possible solution should you desire to provide and install an array. Regardless of source, please direct lighting downwards or outwards from the Pavilion so it doesn’t interfere with the lighting set near the Man.\n\nThe Man team will work with selected artists to determine exact placement of electricals within the defined space. We intend to have it installed prior to your arrival. We invision this being a single quad-recepticle box installed at ground level from which you can run power distribution to your elements, but we are open to supporting your other needs. Please ask in your proposal.\n\nPlease plan to bury electrical extension cords. It’s best if you have something in your design that sits over top of the quad box and hides it so we don’t find people unplugging your lighting to charge their cell phones (just a little experience on the matter).\n\nIn terms of an overall complimentary lighting scheme within the Pavilion space, we anticipate utilizing primarily cool tones of purple and blue in neon, and warm, clean light from the cocoon. Please describe your ideas for lighting color and temperature.\n\nSet-Up and Strike\n\nOther Stuff That Might Be Useful to Know\n\nPre-event, on-site set-up:\n\nDuring the event:\n\nContracts and Plans\n\nBurning Man Project will contract and coordinate the selected proposals. The selected designers will need to participate in pre-installation logistics meetings and provide drawings, sketches and specifications to our team as needed. We understand that the proposed project may slightly evolve during the finalization of the design and build plan. If your plans change significantly from what you propose, we’ll need to work with you to review and approve the changes.\n\nProject Timeline\n\nIf you have questions while creating your submittal, you may email them to kimba@burningman.org. We’ll update this blog post with relevant Q&A’s.\n\nProposals are due on April 15 at 11:59 pm Pacific Time, and we anticipate making a decision in early May. Once we have selected the proposals, we will issue a contract and begin work on nailing down installation plans.\n\nThe Man Pavilion opens on Sunday, August 25. Your piece must be fully installed and your installation debris removed from the site no later than noon on Sunday, August 25\n\nEvaluation and Award Process\n\nThe team reviewing your submissions will include creative types in the Art Department along with members of the Man Pavilion crew.\n\nThe creative team will evaluate proposals based on adherence to the request, innovative thinking, testing and prototyping new ideas for gathering places, visual appeal, and feasibility.\n\nSubmission Details\n\nThe proposal form includes a range of questions about your basic contact information and details of your experience and project. Please submit your proposal here.",
