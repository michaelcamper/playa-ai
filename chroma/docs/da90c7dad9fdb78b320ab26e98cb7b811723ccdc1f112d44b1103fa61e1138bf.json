The Hun here, reporting from Gerlach with your first set of SCORES!\n\nAnd what a great start your DPW Playa Restoration team is off to. The front line kicked off at 10:00 and Liminal, and marched through block after dusty block — passing through the entire area of Liminal, Kindergarten and Journey! Talk about a “rite of passage” for our intrepid DPW team.\n\nNow I’m proud to announce the results of that march:\n\nDA, our DPW Playa Restoration Manager, had this recap:\n\nWe traditionally start the Line Sweeps on the back blocks, which are usually less MOOPy, as a warm-up to get them up to speed and give them a chance to get into their rhythm.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts to this game, so it’s really important for the team to get in synch with each other and remember how the game is played before we tackle the dense double-wide blocks of Esplanade.\n\nInitial estimates project that the MOOP Map for Day 1 is approximately 95% Green, 4% Yellow and 1% Red.\n\nLine Sweeps are essentially a MOOP marathon in the blazing hot sun. The greenest of the green blocks were averaging about 8 minutes, which is about as fast as it gets. There were a few long stretches of Yellow that slowed us down a bit but nothing too terrible.\n\nYes, we had some minor missteps in the 10:00 corner — but as a whole, you J-K-L folks, you knocked it out of the park. Way to support the Leave No Trace ethic! Let’s have a round of applause.\n\nMOOP How-To: Rebar and Tent Stakes\n\nNow, let’s talk about something our Restoration MOOPers find all the time: tent stakes and rebar. They sure are useful for keeping your tent in one spot — but when the event is over, how do you get them out of hard-packed ground?\n\nHere’s an informational video, created by DPW’s own Patches the Jew, that addresses this very question. The solution is simple: a pair of vise grips and a steady twist-and-pull motion. Why, I myself have pulled up scores of rebar posts with this technique, and I never so much as broke a nail!\n\nWatch and learn:\n\nThat’s all for today, sports fans. The BLM inspection is just two weeks away, so keep on cheering for your brave and hardworking Restoration team.\n\nTune in tomorrow for the results of Day Two! ‘Til then, this is The Hun signing off.",
