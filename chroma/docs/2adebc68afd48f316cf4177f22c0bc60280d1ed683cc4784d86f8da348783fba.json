  "content": "We’re mostly all back, mostly all cleaned up, time for some reports back on how we did with this whole green thing.\n\nCouple stats right off the back: the wood recycling set a new record: 56 units of lumber loaded down 4 flatbeds, all donated to Habitat For Humanity in Reno.\n\nAlso, the composting project with the City of San Francisco loaning out their curbside green bins was a huge hit–we loaded out an entire 30 yard dumpster of gooey wet green waste, and sent it off to Full Circle Compost down in Minden.\n\nBut what I’m most curious about was your experience, your efforts, what you encountered/saw/felt/did. Drop a line, let’s hear how the green man worked out for you: environment@burningman.com.\n\nThanks, look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n-Tom Price\n\nEnvironmental Manager, Burning Man 2007",
