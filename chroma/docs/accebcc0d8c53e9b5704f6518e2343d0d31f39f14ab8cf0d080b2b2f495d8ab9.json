  "content": "I think all the digital Burning is great.  But that doesn’t mean we should have ZERO in-person Playa experiences.  Even though large gatherings are a terrible idea, I’m of the mind that is possible to have responsible, socially-distanced interactions.\nWhich is why my partner and I decided to turn our front yard into a Theme Camp.\nFirst we set up a storage unit’s worth of pink decor in our front yard.\nThen I put this letter up on our fence and posted it on NextDoor.com:\n\nThe response has been INCREDIBLE.   So much love and positivity from neighbors and nearby Burners.  I’ve been Gifting water bottles filled with chilled cucumber water, stickers, and vegan ice cream.   Even beneath their masks, the smiles are beaming.\n\nAbove all, I have appreciated the excuse to fully express my Burner self in my default neighborhood.  After living here for 1.5 years, I’ve now met neighbors I’ve never spoken to before.   It was a little scary, initially.   Once I announced to the neighborhood that there is a weirdo living here, there would be no way to hide.   But Burning Man is all about pushing past our edges and stretching into who we can be in the world.  (Of course, the pink hair and pink motorhome probably tipped them off, already.)\n\nNow I want to do Porch Camp more often.  I want to encourage local Burners to do the same.  We could do quarterly bike tours around the neighborhood to visit one another’s Porch Camps.  Who’s in!?!?\n\nP.S.  There is still plenty of time to set up your Porch Camp for 2020!!! Let’s see what you got!\n\nP.P.S.\nThere are NorCal and Florida Pink Heart Porch Camps, too!\n\nHeader image courtesy of Halcyon",
