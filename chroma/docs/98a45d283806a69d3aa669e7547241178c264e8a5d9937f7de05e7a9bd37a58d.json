  "content": "Strong winds put the Burn on hold for awhile last night, but The Man finally went up in flames around 11 p.m. The harsh conditions earlier in the evening forced the cancellation of the fire conclave beforehand. By the time the big guy burned, though, the dust storms had cleared and the night had turned beautiful.\n\nLots more pics and a wrapup post in a day or two.\n\nThe Man burns in 364 days.",
