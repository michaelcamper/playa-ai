  "content": "It feels like Burning Man themes fall into three categories.\n\nFirst, there are the “Literal” themes that have some way to map them conveniently to the physical world. Like, The Body, Floating World, Carnival of Mirrors and I, Robot. It isn’t difficult to think of imagery that you could incorporate into a theme camp design, mutant vehicle or sticker. Floating World? How about a big fish? Or a sea anemone?\n\nThen there are the ones that are more philosophical. I imagine these were decided upon while fingers and toes were pruning in late-night, hot tub convos. Examples like Hope and Fear, Beyond Belief and Psyche are a little harder to visualize.\n\nThe final category of themes is, “Ways to Describe Burning Man.”\n\nRadical Ritual, Rites of Passage and Evolution are basically MadLibs responses to: “The Burning Man experience is a ___________.”\n\nTo me, Metamorphoses falls into this category. (Although, once I see how many people adopt butterfly wings this year, I may change my tune to, “Easy to design on a sticker.”)\n\nBut I love the theme. I love the added focus in our minds and conversations on WHY this place and 10 Principles change us so much.\n\nThe video below was recorded live and is a personal dive into this year’s theme.  How have I seen metamorphoses be a part of the Burn experience for over the last 21 years and how has my personal metamorphosis created a ripple effect of metamorphosis in the default world.\n\nNOTE: I am not a part of Burning Man staff. Just a passionate participant like you.\n\nHow have you gone through a metamorphosis? How has your dust-inspired change affected the default world?",
