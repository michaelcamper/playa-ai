  "content": "The last of the Art Installation pages are up so come and read all about the amazing crop of ART you’ll be interacting with this year. We’ve got our Honorarium Art, The CORE (Circle of Regional Effigies), Art of Black Rock City and Cafe Art.\n\nOnce again Jim Tierney (Anarchist Jim) and Evonne Heyning and the whole Artery Team have put together individual Audio Art Tours for a wide variety of Installations. You can download a couple or get them all in a zip file. Bring them with you on your trips around the playa to really get some insight on these magnificent pieces.\n\nTake a look and a listen and then YOU can be the one who, when you’re out there looking at this amazing thing before you with your friends, can say, “Well, that project was created by… and the artist says this and that….” for which your friends will no doubt be quite grateful and much spontaneous wonder and artistic appreciation will ensue.\n\nYes, it promises to be a great year once again. Enjoy it everyone!",
