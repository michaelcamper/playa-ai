  "content": "BMIR, Burning Man Information Radio (94.5FM on the playa and on the internet), is the best way to let the citizens of Black Rock City know about your theme camp, art installation or events. Now that you know your playa address it’s the perfect time to create a promo telling every one all about it. BMIR would LOVE to have them in hand before they leave for the playa so they can start running them on the air ASAP.\n\nBMIR is going to start running theme camp and event promo announcements as soon as you can get them to us. You can tune in to BMIR via the internet and hear about what the playa has in store for you. Many people now stream BMIR on their smartphones during their drive to the playa. We’ll be live from the playa sometime on Wednesday 8/20 — listen in to find out about the weather, late breaking news you need to know, and info on how the city is coming together.\n\nIf someone in your camp is an audio whiz they can send us your promos at any time. Not sure how to record something ahead of time? No worries! J Kanizzle, BMIR’s Co-Station Manager, has put together this handy tutorial that shows you how to download and configure Audacity, a free audio recording program. The tutorial then takes you through the basics of creating your very own announcement.\n\nOnce you have something recorded, or if you have any questions, please email BMIR at BMIR@Burningman.com before August 20.\n\nRemember to let people know the basics: what, where and when. Please keep announcements under 60 seconds and send them to us in .mp3 format at 320kbps. Please don’t send us 10 announcements for all of your individual events. Most camps send one announcement.\n\nCan’t make the August 20 deadline? You can also put your announcements on a CD or flash drive and hand deliver them to BMIR on the playa. BMIR is located in Center Camp, 1:15 and Rod’s Road, right between Ranger HQ and The Earth Guardians.\n\nNow if you just can’t pull this off, no worries. The BMIR Production Studio will be open every day from 12N to 4PM during the event. You can come in and we will help you record an announcement right on the playa.",
