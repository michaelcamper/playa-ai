  "content": "No one could have imagined that a small Solstice gathering of friends on a San Francisco beach could spark such an epic network of collaborators. And so, on Solstice we celebrate the birth of the Man, and the culture that continues to emanate from that formative moment.\n\nReady for all the feels? Hit play and enjoy footage from the first Man Burn on Baker Beach and our original instigator Larry Harvey, plus some raucous scenes from Burning Man’s early years in the Black Rock Desert of Northern Nevada.\n\n(Source: Why We Burn the Man from Burning Man on Vimeo)\n\nHappy birthday to the Burnerverse, and to that spark which drives each of us to play, imagine, co-create and organize community. We like to imagine that this wide world is now filled with thousands of formative events like that 1986 Solstice Burn, each the catalyst for ever-evolving, mind-bending art and experiences that will continue to impact the world long after we’re all gone.\n\nThanks, Larry.",
