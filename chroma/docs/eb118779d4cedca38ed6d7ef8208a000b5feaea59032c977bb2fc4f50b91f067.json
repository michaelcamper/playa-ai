  "content": "Burning Man is not your typical festival … not by a longshot.  If you’re a first timer, you honestly don’t have any idea what you’re really in for — and just how great (or miserable) your Burning Man experience will be is directly proportional to how well you’ve prepared. Lucky for you, there are a LOT of veteran Burners who are eager to share their expertise with you to get you oriented so that you’re ready to take this incredible experience head-on and rock it.  They’re gifting their time and talents to help the greater community … because that’s what we do (Gifting and Communal Effort are two of the Ten Principles, after all).  Read on, and find one in your local area (they’re in no particular order). Also, you’re encouraged to hook up with your local Regional Network group and get connected.\n\nChicago: \nLate July\nSee burningmanchicago.com for updates\n\nPortland, OR:\n“Burning Man for Beginners” orientation class in May 2012, details will be posted at BurningmanPortland.com\n\nSeattle:\nNow in its tenth year, the Seattle Regional Newbie Picnic has something for everyone!

Food and beverages will be provided but note – this is an ALL-AGES, ALCOHOL FREE event. No really, alcohol free. It’s in a public park.\n\nDate: Sunday July 29th\nLocation: Heart of the Burner Triangle: Judkins Park SW Corner.

This is Diana the Bcn RC and I wanted to let you know about our event that will take place on April 28th. It is called Barcelona Burning Bash (BBB) and we will highlight the Gifting principle. The idea is that every edition highlights one of the 10 principles. At this event we will give the participators a little taste of the Burning Man culture, starting out with “Dust Devils” a 45 minute documentary on Burning Man and several other videos including “Gifting” by Halcyon. We will also infuse gifting into the experience by inviting people to participate in interactive games with gifting-like interactions, and giving participants “love-notes” with transformational messages. The night will be blessed with many performances by dancers, musicians, dj’s, artists, and circus freaks. We will also have a costume camp and a “Ask-a-Burner” booth. This booth will be hosted by experienced burners where newbies can ask questions and sign-up for mailing lists. Our event will also focus a lot on our regional event Nowhere. Our intention is to inform locals about the BM culture and inspire them to participate in our community, Nowhere and Burning Man. have a look at the FB event page https://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/events/344560798916741/\n\nMonterey, CA:\nSpring Fling Campout & Ranger Roundup\nFremont Peak, California\nJune 15-17\n$20/per person includes camping on Friday & Saturday night – kids under 18 free with parent or legal guardian\n$10/per person – day pass\nDuring this campout there will be a Ranger Training, Black Rock Scouts Training and Virgin Workshop.\nVirgin Workshop will be on Saturday, June 16, at  11a.\nwww.montereyburners.com to register for the campout or for your day pass.\nFacebook event: http://www.facebook.com/events/158449297608278/\n\nLos Angeles:\nWe will be hosting three Newbie Orientations before the Burn.
