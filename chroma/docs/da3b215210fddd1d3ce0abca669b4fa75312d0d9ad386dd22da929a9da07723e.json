  "content": "The Black Rock City Census is a volunteer-led, sanctioned research project aimed at collecting and analyzing data that BRC participants provide to us through voluntary participation — we conduct a random sample of Burners entering the event, then collect online survey responses after the Burn. This data serves as an essential annual resource for understanding the demographics, behaviors, and experiences of Burners. This report is a treasure trove of information, revealing not just statistics but also the spirit and ethos of all playa citizens.\n\nDuring the 2022 event and in a Journal post from October 2022, we published some preliminary numbers highlighting some of the demographic info that was collected through our random sample. Now, we’re excited to share the full report from last year’s event.\n\nDemographics: Who Are the Burners?\n\nThe BRC Census report provides a comprehensive demographic breakdown Black Rock City’s population. It reveals interesting insights into the age distribution, gender representation, educational background, profession, and geographic origins of the participants. This diversity fosters a rich and inclusive cultural experience that transcends most societal boundaries.\n\nAge\n\nThe median age of participants coming to Black Rock City has been steadily increasing by just under one year every year since we began trend analysis in 2013. The median age of a citizen of Black Rock City 2022 was 37 years old, compared to 32 in 2013.\n\nCurrent Gender\n\nMore males attend Burning Man than females or other gender identities annually. There has been a slight decrease in male participants and increase in female and other gender identities since 2013. In 2013, 58.3% (57.3%, 59.2%) of participants identified their gender as male compared to 54.3% (53.1, 55.5%) in 2022.\n\nEthnoracial Identity\n\nThe number of Burners identifying as a Person of Color has grown slightly from 7.3% (6.8%, 7.8%) in 2013 to 13.3 % (12.5%,14.2%) in 2022. Much of this increase can be attributed to the decrease in participants who responded “Sometimes.” 80.5% (79.5%, 81.5%) of respondents reported their ethnoracial background as White (non-hispanic). The next largest ethnoracial group was Hispanic/Latino at a reported 9.6% (8.9%, 10.4%), followed by Asian, 8.0% (7.4%, 8.8%), Middle Eastern or North African 3.0% (2.6%, 3.5%), Black (non-Hispanic) 2.2% (1.9%, 2.6%). The least represented population in Black Rock City 2022 was Native American 1.4% (1.2%, 1.7%). 3.3% (2.9%, 3.8%) identified as Other.\n\nWhere Are Burners From?\n\nMost citizens of Black Rock City travel to the Nevada desert from California 38.1% (36.9%, 39.2%). The next largest group comes from Nevada at 4.3 % (3.9, 4.8%). Other states in the U.S. make up 41.5% (40.3, 42.7%) of the population. Canadians make up 4.4% (4.0%, 5.0%) of the population, and 11.7% (10.9, 12.5) travel to Black Rock City from other countries outside of the U.S. and Canada.\n\nFirst-Year Participants/Virgins\n\nThe percent of participants engaging with Black Rock City for the first time, known as virgins, had been steadily decreasing from 2016 — where nearly 40% of citizens in Black Rock City were there for the first time — to approximately 26% in 2019. 2022 saw a slight uptick, with about 28% of participants being identified as virgins.\n\nParticipation and Engagement: Embracing the 10 Principles\n\nThe 10 Principles sit at the core of Burning Man culture. The data report sheds light on how participants embrace and embody Radical Inclusion, Radical Self-reliance, Communal Effort, Gifting, and more during the event. It showcases the incredible spirit of collaboration, artistry, and interactivity that pervades Black Rock City. Participants report annually that the 10 Principles are essential to creating an authentic Burning Man experience.\n\nHow important do you feel the 10 Principles are?\n\nThe experience of participating in Black Rock City inspires many Burners to volunteer beyond Black Rock City. On average, about 50% of participants reported being inspired to volunteer, donate, or get involved in other ways after Black Rock City.\n\nImpact and Sustainability: Leave No Trace!\n\nAn essential aspect of the Burning Man ethos is the commitment to Leaving No Trace, minimizing the environmental impact. In 2019, Burning Man Project made a commitment to be net-carbon negative by 2030. To meet this ambitious goal, the organization has made shifts in practice, working towards greater sustainability, and has asked the Burning Man community to join these efforts. Participants reported this to be essential, and noticed new sustainability projects while in Black Rock City 2022. Learn more about the Burning Man Project Environmental Sustainability Roadmap here.\n\nHow important to you is it that the Burning Man Project visibly engages in best practices in environmental sustainability?\n\nParticipants reported noting more solar power in Black Rock City in 2022. Other initiatives of note were camp efforts to be more sustainable and that the theme reflected in more art projects.\n\nRadical Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (R.I.D.E.)\n\nAnother important initiative of Burning Man Project is Radical Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (R.I.D.E). This cross-departmental Stewardship Group is responsible for prioritizing, managing, and advocating for R.I.D.E work across Burning Man Project staff, Black Rock City, and Burner communities in the US and internationally.\n\nHow did you see R.I.D.E. in action while in BRC?\n\nThe call for Radical Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity at Burning Man is not the work of the R.I.D.E Stewardship Group alone. All members of the Burning Man community are called to make changes to create a more diverse and inclusive Black Rock City. Participants identified ways they personally worked to create a more diverse and welcoming Black Rock City in 2022.\n\nHow did you personally work to create a more diverse and welcoming Black Rock City?\n\nNurturing the Burner Community\n\nThe Black Rock City Census data report goes beyond mere statistics; it offers a glimpse into the heart and soul of Black Rock City. It reveals a community that embodies the Principles of Radical Self-expression, Radical Inclusion, and Participation. From the diverse demographics to the profound emotional experiences, the report paints a vivid picture of this transformative event.\n\nWe encourage you to delve deeper into the data. We hope you are reminded of the power of communal living and the potential of Burning Man and Black Rock City to inspire positive change in society. BRC Census aims to showcase the capacity of humans to come together, celebrate art, embrace differences, and co-create a world where the 10 Principles are not just confined to the desert but spread far and wide. Whether we will see you in Black Rock City 2023 soon or you are simply curious about the magic of Burning Man, the full 2022 Census Report will undoubtedly leave you captivated and inspired by the boundless possibilities of human connection and self-expression.\n\nWondering about self-selection bias?
