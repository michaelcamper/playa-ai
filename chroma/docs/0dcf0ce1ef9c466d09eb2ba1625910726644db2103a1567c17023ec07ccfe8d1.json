  "content": "Since then, in a matter of days:\n\nHow’s that for getting a jump on things?\n\nMany other things are happening, some behind the scenes. But the point is, if you have to go from nothing to 70,000 people in a matter of three weeks, you’d best make the most of your time. That appears to be happening.\n\n—\n\nWe wandered out with the Commissary squads as they worked long into the night to get the giant tent squared away. It was a bit of a departure to be working at night, but high winds had put a wrench to the schedule. This was the second night in a row they had been out there; the previous night, a crew of about 15 sledge-hammered all the anchors into place. This also was a departure, as sledge-hammering on this scale is usually an all-hands event, and folks compete to be the most badass sledge-hammerer around. But not this time. The dang wind kept the operation from happening during the day, so it was just the relatively small crew that had to do all the heavy pounding.\n\nNow they were out here again, first to put down tarps so that spills wouldn’t reach the delicate desert floor, and then to unpack and place the square pieces of plastic that provides an even walking surface and further protects the playa.\n\nMaybe the least fun part of the proceedings is taking out all the equipment and gear from the containers where they have been stored for the offseason. Shockingly, none of the pieces of flooring had been dusted and cleaned before being put away, so every one of the hundreds of squares was covered in old playa dust, which only made the job that much more fun.\n\nBut it had to be done. As Sylkia explained, “We can’t be eating at Bruno’s all week.”\n\n—\n\nThe HEaT crew (Heavy Equipment and Transportation) is always one of the first groups to establish a presence on playa. They’re  the folks with the people and the equipment to help everyone else get their camps squared away, so they go first.\n\nThey started moving in on Friday, even as the Fence operation was going on. There was one small snafu, however.  Cuervo, the honcho of HEaT, believes in the importance of fire, and he wants a fire on the first night they are in the desert. Alas, the person who was supposed to bring the burn platform and the wood got bogged down with other tasks. So there they were at 5 pm on the first day, and Cuervo noticed the absence of the fire items. The situation was quickly rectified, and the first bonfire of the season lit up the night a few hours later.\n\n—\n\nAs we mentioned, the great migration from town to playa has begun. Hundreds of people and their assorted living arrangements have to move. It’ll be cozy and collegial when things are squared away, but in the meantime, there’s a lot of stuff that has to get from here to there.\n\nAs this takes place, food will be available in two locations for a couple of days; on playa starting Wednesday, and in town until Friday. Today saw the last morning meeting at Bruno’s; they’ll be at the Depot on playa starting Thursday.\n\nOh, that means a day without a 7:30 morning meeting. Huzzah!\n\nHere are some more pics:",
