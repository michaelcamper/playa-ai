It’s an exciting time out here in the ruins of Black Rock City, where the Playa Restoration team is sweeping through the city grid at an unprecedented pace. They knocked out another 54 blocks in their third day on the field, making quick work of the inner blocks where you, I and most of our friends made our homes.\n\nHow did YOUR camp score on the MOOP Map? Read on to find out.\n\nStop Before You Start: MOOP Prevention Tactics\n\nWe all know we need to keep our MOOP under control in order to pass the annual BLM inspection, so Burning Man can keep happening in the Black Rock Desert. But actually controlling that MOOP is a unique challenge, and one we can only perfect through experience.\n\nThat’s where YOU come in, Black Rock City! Do you have special tricks for pesky MOOP like wood chips, gray water, burn barrel cinders? Please, share them in the comments. Here are a few of our favorites:\n\nThanks to the amazing nikOpeachZ, one of our MOOP Line Bosses, for these tips!\n\nWhat else ya got, Black Rock City? Chime in below.\n\nDay 3 Results\n\nAnd here it is folks: The one and only MOOP Map.\n\nLookin’ pretty good out there, folks. Today, the MOOP Line swept from 2:00 to 7:00 between Foxglove and Iris, and for the most part, they sailed through without a care.\n\nUnfortunately, there were a few spots — especially those camps from 2:00 to 3:00 between F and G — that slowed our intrepid team down. Those yellow zones take a lot more time to clean up, but the MOOP Line powered through … until they reached 5:30, which happens to be a place many DPW call home for about six weeks of the year. Yes, that’s right, we left ourselves a yellow zone to clean up at our very own camp. But clean it up we did, with a shared resolve to Do Better Next Year.\n\nMost of you out there know about Doing Better Next Year, and overall today was a big win for YOU, Black Rock City. Congratulations on keeping it clean, and here’s to all of us who keep finding new ways to stop MOOP and fight the Leave No Trace battle!\n\nFor now, this is The Hun, fighting on.\n\nPhoto by Vertumnus!",
