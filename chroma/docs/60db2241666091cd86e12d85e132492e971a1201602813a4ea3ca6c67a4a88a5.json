  "content": "Leaving No Trace was just the beginning.\n\nAs Burning Man’s Environmental Restoration Manager since 2005, the worldwide Burner community, has shown me that 80,000 people can build and burn a temporary city in the Black Rock Desert and still leave the environment looking clean, beautiful, and without a trace.\n\nIn this unprecedented year without Burning Man, I believe the time is now to go above and beyond our community’s success as the largest practicing Leave No Trace event in the world and plan for the future of an environmentally sustainable Burning Man.\n\nWe’ve created a Sustainability Team to study and implement best practices around energy generation and conservation as well as to explore other possibilities in supporting our ambitious goal of a  carbon-negative Black Rock City by 2030 as announced in the Burning Man’s Sustainability Roadmap. Black Rock City, you have made a believer out of me, and I believe we can do this. However, in this year of challenges, we need also to create innovative ways to fund our sustainability initiatives.\n\nSo, to this end, straight up, I’m announcing an audacious environmental fundraiser!\n\nA hold-my-beer moment if you will! Yours truly, DA, the Dark Angel of Black Rock, 24 year Burner, founder of the Playa Restoration All-Star Team and the MOOP Map, will be raising money to jumpstart Burning Man’s Sustainability Initiatives by walking all the way to the Black Rock Desert starting from Wadsworth, NV along Highway 447 to State Route 34, cleaning up all Matter Out of Place (MOOP) and leaving no trace!\n\nThat’s 85 miles! It’s gonna take 8 days! I’ve set the goal at $80,000 in hopes to inspire the 80,000 annual participants and the greater worldwide Burner Community to support an environmentally sustainable Burning Man! I hit the road Friday, June 26, and land on the playa on Friday, July 3.\n\nDONATE HERE\n\nPlease consider a donation at this time, follow my story for live updates, hit share, and help light this endeavor on fire! Leaving No Trace was just the beginning!\n\nFor all you Leave No Trace enthusiasts, if you are so inspired, feel free to join the fun with Burners Without Borders In Solidarity with DA’s Black Rock MOOPATHON by leading a simultaneous cleanup effort in your local Burner Community!\n\nTHANK YOU AND LEAVE NO TRACE!",
