  "content": "In his keynote speech at this week’s Google I/O developers conference, Google CEO (and long-time Burner) Larry Page suggested the world would benefit from a temporary (if not permanent?) autonomous zone free of social rules where people can experiment with new technologies and innovations, free of the restrictions inherent in attempting to deploy them broadly in the normal world. Essentially, a technology-specific Burning Man.\n\nAs reported by TechCrunch, Mr. Page says:\n\nSuffice to say, we couldn’t agree more.\n\nHere’s more coverage on the talk from Silicon Beat and CNN, and his full speech can be seen here.",
