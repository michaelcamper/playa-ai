  "content": "Art season has arrived! Read on to see the list of art installations selected for 2016 Black Rock City Honoraria grants.\n\nDa Vinci’s Workshop is going to be a spectacular theme. You’ll see Leonardo’s influence everywhere; think flying machines, the movements of the heavenly bodies, lighthouses and lenses and optical illusions. There will even be a functioning, participatory blacksmith shop — the Piazza de Ferro — built by the Iron Monkeys. Sparks will fly!\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum of Leonardo’s fascinations, this year’s submissions contained lots of animal, anatomical forms: a whale, a giant insect, gorillas, an octopus, a bear, a boar, a herd of horses, and a 12-foot tall fire-breathing Kaiju MechaGator!\n\nThere was an unusually high number of mushroom-themed submissions this year. Maybe Leonardo was into that, too!\n\nBut not all the news is about what’s new; Black Rock City 2016 will see the return of some of the greatest art and artists in its storied history. We are thrilled to announce that David Best will return with his crew to build the Temple this year for the ninth time. His most recent Temple in BRC was 2014’s Temple of Grace. Remember that one? The one called “Grace” that collapsed with a perfect pirouette into its own footprint when it burned? We can look forward to something new and equally amazing from this year’s Temple.\n\nOther Black Rock City favorites returning to the playa this year will include Kate Raudenbush, HYBYCOZO, Michael Christian and Christopher Schardt. Medusa Madness will also return for an encore, and if you didn’t see it come alive at the end of last year’s event… well, get ready.\n\nBurning Man Arts is funding BRC art to the tune of $1.2 million this year, including these Honoraria recipients, as well as the sculptures, the bell towers, and the 33 Guild Workshops in the Piazza around the Man.\n\nSeven international projects received Honoraria grants, two in Canada and one each in England, India, New Zealand, Russia and Spain. Four Honoraria recipients have never been to Black Rock City, and 21 more are leading a project for the first time. And no report on Burning Man art would be complete without mentioning that, of the 60 projects granted BRC Honoraria, 20 of them will play with fire.\n\nOf course, most of the art in BRC is stuff people just decide to up and do, with or without outside funding. So take a virtual stroll through the 2016 BRC Honoraria projects, and if you have some vision that is missing from the list, you are warmly invited to make it happen.\n\nFull project descriptions with images will be available later in the season.\n\n2016 Black Rock City Honoraria Recipients\n\n10 Benches of Sitting Man, The — Amber Coutts — Felton, CA\n\nAdventure Vending Machine — Rick Rothbart — Oakland, CA\n\nAutomata Equis — Heather Stewart — Oakland, CA\n\nAwakening — Ryan Elmendorf and Nick Geurts — Wheat Ridge, CO\n\nBlack Rock City Supper Club — Carlyn Perona and Dave King — Reno, NV\n\nBlack Rock Lighthouse Project, The — Max Poynton and Hel Skelter Inc. — San Francisco, CA\n\nBurntanical Garden — Lynn Gamroth — Washoe Valley, NV\n\nCadillac Ranch Remixed — Keith Muscutt — Santa Cruz, CA\n\nCatacomb of Veils — Dan Sullivan — San Francisco, CA\n\nCelestial Mechanica — Jessika Welz — San Francisco, CA\n\nChiminea Planetaria — Spencer Kane Edgerton (AKA Ranger Quicksilver) — Tucson, AZ\n\nChronosydra — Kathryn Greenberg and Dust Crusaders — San Francisco, CA\n\nDaVinci Virus — Brennan Steele — New Orleans, LA\n\nDreams of Flight — Michael Gard — San Francisco, CA\n\nDust City Diner — Michael Brown — San Francisco, CA\n\nDusty Supper, The — Jamie Joyce — Winter Park, FL\n\nEnunciation — Taylor Harrison — Los Angeles, CA\n\nFirmament — Christopher Schardt — Oakland, CA\n\nFlocons — Anna-Gaelle Marshall and Dusty Visions — Portland, OR\n\nFractal Rock — Pooja Shah and Stijn van der Linden — Fremont, CA\n\nGiant Weta, The — Andrew Benson and Auckland Burners — Auckland, New Zealand\n\nGrove — Shilo Shiv Suleman, Saba Ghole, Sean Stevens — Bangalore, India\n\nHelios — Kate Raudenbush — New York, NY\n\nHorizon Lines — Tyler Buckheim — Key West, FL\n\nHYBYCOZO – Heart of Gold — Yelena Filipchuk and Serge Beaulieu — Oakland, CA\n\nIdentity Reorganization Portal — Michael Emery — Santa Cruz, CA\n\nImago — Kirsten Berg — Berkeley, CA\n\nIntention — Will Buchanan — Oakland, CA\n\nJar of Sand — Trish Dolman — Vancouver, Canada\n\n“Jedi Temple” – “ Dog Temple” – “Jedi Dog Temple” (Working Title / Kids Temple) — Sagan Bocskor — Las Vegas, NV\n\nKoi Pond, The — JoeJoe Martin — San Francisco, CA\n\nLast Apothecary, The — Shing Yin Khor and the Black Rock Civilian Defense Corps — Los Angeles, CA\n\nLe Attrata — Therm — Oakland, CA\n\nLord Snort — Bryan Tedrick — Glen Ellen, CA\n\nMAHALYCH (Birding Man) — Vasily Shchetinin / Василий Щетинин — Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nMechaGator, The — Ryan S.
