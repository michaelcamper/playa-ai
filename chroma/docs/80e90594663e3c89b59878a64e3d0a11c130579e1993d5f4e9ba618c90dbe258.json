  "content": "It is that time of year again when many individuals and groups are taking concepts and ideas turning them into to Art Proposals. It is a beautiful time for the creative spirit when every wacky concept seems possible to build. That inspired vision you had last year or that long festering idea is being sketched out, budgets are being drawn up, 3D renderings helping to visualize the genius, goofy handmade models painstakingly being hot glued together (tongue depressors, pipe cleaners and all) and all that conceptual blah dee blah is being churned out.\n\nThe moments when an idea is being hatched is a magical time in the process of artistic creation.\n\nIt is also that time of year when one who has created work for Burning Man in previous years also thinks, if I make another piece, where the hell will I store it? Which artspace, whose back yard, the dump, which kiddie rave or music fest as decoration, some cheap storage facility…..\n\nWhen it is not burned or destroyed where does it go after the playa? Who’s responsibility is it? Will it ever see the light of day again?\n\nThanks to organizations like BRAF some of this work does see the light of day again. The City of Reno in Conjunction with BRAF have been working in collaboration displaying work such as Kate Raudenbush’s Dual Nature. The Raygun Gothic Rocketship enjoys its launch pad on the Embarcadero until October 2011. Ecstasy by Karen Cusilito & Dan Das Mann which has been displayed by the Hayes Valley art Coalition is heading home to American Steel this month. More potential display space will also be open up in San Francisco’s Mid Market area (Market Street between 4th & 10th St). And BRAF is currently working with the San Francisco Arts Commission (which received an NEA grant) on new creative ideas.\n\nNow that there is an established track record of displaying of Burning Man artwork outside the boundaries of the Black Rock Desert, how do we lead, participate and frame the discussion around the greater cultural implications of this type of artwork? Participatory art has excelled at Burning Man, but not in a vacuum, the larger international artworld is paying attention to the audiences demand for active engagement with art.  German cultural writer Diedrich Diederichsen in the contemporary art journal Frieze discusses that “We need to look for a new active role for the audience. One constant factor in each development of the culture industry over the past hundred years is an increase in audience participation, or at least of a certain participatory effect.”  Each year the art at Burning Man is pushing this participatory effect, and since we are the experts we should be participating and driving the dialogue about it.\n\nHow are we supposed to lead the discussion? I know I don’t have the answers, but I do feel the timing is right.  I’ll leave you with some food for thought. Artist Larnie Fox wrote in 1997 a very significant statement about the art happening at Burning Man he saw it as part of a larger movement to expand the boundaries of the artworld to include site-specific, culturally specific, interactive, temporal, and collaborative art in the contemporary art dialogue.",
