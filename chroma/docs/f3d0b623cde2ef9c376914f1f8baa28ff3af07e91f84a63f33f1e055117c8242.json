  "content": "Burning Man Arts is thrilled to announce the art installations selected for Black Rock City 2022 Honorarium art grants. There’s nothing quite like the announcement of our Honoraria artists to get us psyched to build our city in the dust, and our anticipation is higher than ever after two years away from the playa.\n\nThings are starting to get real!\n\nSome Insights Into the Selection Process\n\nWhen we select the Honoraria projects, the artworks we fund reflect an experience we would like to create, rather than a value judgment. We don’t choose the “best” artworks, but rather look to build a collection that offers a full range of experiences for participants.\n\nOur goal is to include representation from a variety of categories, from large to small, silly to serious, sculptural to architectural, outlandish to quietly contemplative, experienced artists to first-timers, monochromatic to colorful, and everything in between. We’re always keeping in mind interactivity, visual impact, and sheer creativity. Finally, we lean into diversity and environmental sustainability, and how the Honoraria Program can align with these important organizational goals.\n\nThis year the selection process was unique, because 52 of the 2020 Honoraria artists who stuck with us these past two years will return in 2022. That means that going into this year’s process, we already had a fabulous collection of projects. As a result, we selected fewer artworks than usual, and it was important to make sure the new projects filled creative gaps and expanded diversity.\n\nWe received 433 Letters of Intent and invited 281 projects to submit full proposals. All in all, we’re excited to say that in this unusual year, we will have 15 more Honoraria projects than in most years, with 88 projects coming to BRC in 2022!\n\nRadical Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity\n\nWe are committed to supporting all kinds of art for all kinds of people.\n\nThoughtful selection of Honoraria projects can help create a multicultural, open, inviting, and inclusive community within Black Rock City. We have a unique opportunity to elevate BIPOC, non-binary, female, and marginalized artists in an extremely visible way, which also furthers Burning Man Project’s values around Radical Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (R.I.D.E.).\n\nFor the first time, we asked each applicant to reflect and share how their project advances the Principle of Radical Inclusion. During the selection process, we appreciated that many artists prioritized diversity. While we don’t inquire about demographics on the grant application, based on the information that artists voluntarily shared in their proposals, 20 percent of this year’s funded projects will have a lead artist of color.\n\nSome highlights of artworks that represent the spectrum of diversity within our community include “The Solar Shrine” by Antwane Lee, an Afrofuturist artwork inspired by the magical realism of Ancient Egypt and Nubia. The piece will be one of the largest burns this year. We are so pleased to have Erin Douglas and the Black Burner Project bring a huge installation, “Behold… From the Dust,” consisting of three monumental portraits of BIPOC Burners. “Build a Seat” led by BIPOC artist Mo Osunbor is a philosophical and physical invitation to Black creatives to join and contribute to the incredible experience of Black Rock City.\n\nWe’ve always had amazing female artists in BRC (Dana Albany, Kate Raudenbush, the Flaming Lotus Girls, Christina Sporrong, and Karen Cusolito to name a few), and 2022 will continue to expand on that tradition. South African artist Usha Seejarim will share “The Resurrection of the Clothes Peg,” a metaphor for the rise of the female voice and an expression of the desire to be heard by the marginalized. We’ll celebrate motherhood with “What to Expect When Expecting” and “I Heart Mom.” And “Circle of Doors Tarot” by Anne Stavely and Jill Sutherland will be a photographic representation of a complete Tarot deck as well as a fiery invocation of deep feminine power. Yes!\n\nSustainable Art\n\nIt’s been nearly three years since Burning Man Project released the 2030 Environmental Sustainability Roadmap, and this year, for the first time, we asked our Honoraria applicants to consider how their projects will address the challenges and opportunities around sustainability.\n\nDave Keane and The Folly Builders are bringing one of the largest projects this year, a wondrously interactive grove of trees called “Paradisium.” They’re putting sustainability at the heart of their work by using reclaimed lumber, planting trees to offset their carbon footprint, and — rather than doing a big burn at the end, as large wooden projects usually do — they’ll be rehoming the trees after the event. Now there’s a cool new approach for 2022 and beyond!\n\n“The Apocalypse is Breathtaking: Flame of the Forest” by Lekha Washington (who brought that amazing moon in 2018) is a Japanese-inspired tree with intricate metal filigree. It’s a commentary on the climate crisis, reflecting that the disastrous state of the world can still be beautiful. She aims to find a permanent home near Nevada to eliminate the need for return travel back to India. Genius! Gray Davidson and Majorelle Arts will highlight endangered animal species in their elegant project “Charismatic Metafauna.” And finally, Tom Boughner and the Desert Propaganda Collective are using reclaimed steel and home appliances rescued from landfills for their project “Consumption,” a commentary on consumerism and overconsumption.\n\nOverall, we’re pleased to report that 36 percent of this year’s projects demonstrate a significant effort towards sustainability. As we move to a more sustainable event, we are also doing a careful review of the number of artworks that will be approved to burn on playa this year, ensuring that burns only happen when they are conceptually warranted.\n\n2022 Highlights and Themes\n\nThere are certain beloved themes that always have a home in Black Rock City. Our ongoing celebration of play will be present in whimsical projects such as “Alien Drive-Thru” (an installation created by aliens who wonder whether food might be a good way to make first contact), “The Jackalope Adventure Guide” (a delightful choose-your-own-adventure oracle), “Heave” by Michael Christian, and coincidentally, two different animal installations with built-in slides: “Chilopod,” a giant insect, and “ATABEY,” a big shiny fish.\n\nOur ongoing love of the weird shows up in “A thousand eyes and a thousand dreams,” the giant eyeball “Oculus,” the monumental “Facing the Fearbeast”, and “Shrine of the Macabre” (why not put giant chicken legs and a flaming calliope on a gothic shrine?!).\n\nSome artworks create environments and explore our sense of place, from planes to trains to oceans. Other projects will explore our current collective consciousness after the past few very unusual years on this planet. “INCENTER” by Kate Greenberg brings the earth inside the home, reflecting on home as a place of refuge and how, through global connection, we’ve shared this time apart together. We received a huge number of applications for projects featuring hearts, a touching response to the past few years, and we’re looking forward to seeing a wide variety of those on playa, from anatomical to graphic to flaming.\n\nOut of the barren landscape of the playa, you will delight in discovering trees! We’ve had a number of trees in BRC over the years, but this year looks to be exceptional (one might even say they are branching out). We’ll have the entire forest of trees in “Paradisium” along with the exquisite tree in “The Apocalypse is Breathtaking.” “FIRE” from Zoe Fry is a grove of fire-damaged manzanita trees. And “Sirsasana – Headstand” is a fun play on the headstand yoga pose, wondering… if a human can do the tree pose in yoga, can a tree do a headstand like a human? Hmm…\n\nIf you love books and reading, you’ll find inspiration in “Unbound: A Library in Transition,” “The Self Help Yourself Library,” and also in “Dreams,” a giant pop-up book where you’re invited to flip the immense pages, bringing them to life through sound and surprise discoveries. “The Little People” is a sculptural installation in resin that features whimsical characters from children’s books. And while “The Solar Library” doesn’t have any books, chosen artists will get a library card to use to charge batteries for their installations.\n\nThis year’s Waking Dreams theme entices artists to make their creative dreams a reality after three long years away from Black Rock City, and it inspired a fun range of creative interpretations. Long-time favorites, the Flaming Lotus Girls are creating “Sea of Dreams,” which conceptualizes a sea of steel origami boats bearing the lore of dreams and approaching a ring of fiery oracles. Not to be confused with “Seed of Dreams,” a gorgeous geometric sculptural head that you can climb into and discover the pineal gland. “Catharsis” is a fractal art gallery for our infinite dreams, and “The Afterlife” is a waking dream that sheds an alternative light on death — with blacklight! It depicts the ethereal realm in colorful glowing beauty, where ancestors are celebrated, and light beings play with mystical creatures in a whimsical wonderland. The surrealist side of this year’s theme will come to life in “The FACE Project” and “Through the Mind’s Eye,” both colorful explorations of deconstruction.\n\nWe’re pleased to have 15 international Honoraria projects this year, representing 17 percent of the total artworks. There are two from Canada, two from Russia, and one each from Austria, Brazil, Germany, Great Britain, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Philippines, South Africa, and Turkey. There are several artists that have just started making art recently, and two Honoraria recipients will be coming to Black Rock City for the first time.\n\nBurning Man is known for fire art, and we are happy to report that 21 Honoraria projects will play with fire and flame effects. One of the coolest will be “Sea of Flames,” a circle of molten metal flaming hearts ablaze with different colors of fire (who wants to see blue, green, and orange flames? Yes, please!). Plus we’re excited to support some sound art, like the playful “People-Powered Music aka The Tinkle Drum,” and the intriguingly experimental “UNPOP,” an intimate, exquisite, spatial listening experience (which does indeed comply with our sound policy).\n\nThere’s so much to be excited about, and we can’t wait to share it all with you.\n\nHow You Can Get Involved\n\nOf course, most of the more than 400 art installations in Black Rock City come without financial support from Burning Man Project. We are serious about our commitment to support ALL artists, so there are many other ways (besides financial) that we help artists to ensure they are successful, such as providing heavy equipment, engineering review, promotion, and partnership with our team all along the way.\n\nSo peruse the following list of 2022 BRC Honoraria projects, and if you have a vision that is missing from the list, you are warmly invited to make it happen. Check out the Art Department’s recent post with info on the Temple and updates on bringing art to Black Rock City in 2022. Do you have skills to contribute and want to help an existing art project? Then please check out our collaboration tool, Spark.\n\nSo without further ado, we’d like to introduce this year’s Honoraria recipients.
