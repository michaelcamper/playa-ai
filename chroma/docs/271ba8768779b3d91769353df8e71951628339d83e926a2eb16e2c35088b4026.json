How can a museum exhibition bring the feeling of Burning Man, not just the art? How can it express the culture? The talking-to-strangers, the random coincidences, the 4-a.m.-trash-fence-grilled-cheese-sandwich? The DUST?\n\nIt can’t express the whole thing, but it doesn’t have to, and it doesn’t intend to. (Particularly the dust; that was a definite “no.”) As we create this portable expression of Burning Man culture, I’ve learned a little bit of cultural context goes a long way.\n\nI was in D.C. recently to present to the Renwick docents who’ll be involved in the Burning Man exhibit. I gave them a look at the community and the culture behind the art, and a discussion of the reasons why people create art for the event. My hope was to share a fuller picture of all the things wiggling around behind the scenes that made these finished products possible. I also challenged them to think about how they could bring the culture and spirit of Burning Man to their own volunteering.\n\nNone of the docents have been to the event. They’re all terrifyingly smart and charming and experienced at being museum docents, and are so excited to learn about Burning Man and share their knowledge, but it’s an uphill battle to try and be Burning Man if you’ve never experienced it firsthand.\n\nThis is where you come in, friendos. Burning Man is made of people, and y’all are the people who make Burning Man, so if we want the exhibition to have the spirit of Burning Man in addition to the art and objects, we have to step up as a community. Communal Effort!\n\nHow You Can Help Burning Man Up the Smithsonian\n\nThe title of the exhibition is “No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man.” People are saying it’s funny that it’s called “No Spectators” when museums are traditionally just for spectating, but what if we thought of it as a clever call to action to figure out how to be Burning Man in a non-traditional setting?\n\nIt’s easy to be Burning Man when you’re at Burning Man, when the people around you know it’s cool to talk to strangers and gift and play, and where the extreme elements break down the social barriers and make it easier to relate to one another. Being Burning Man in a museum setting with people from all walks of life, who don’t have those same expectations? This is your master class in being a Burner.\n\nThe Smithsonian is great at being a museum, and we’re great at being Burning Man. They’re all-in to show off the fruit of our community’s creative drive. It’s up to us to come exhibit our culture and sense of play.\n\nAre you planning a trip to D.C. to see the exhibit? Do you live locally and have the ability to volunteer? Is there no way you’re gonna get there but still want to participate somehow? There are avenues for both in-person and remote participation.\n\nLocals\n\nThe D.C. Burners have been amazing at offering their talents and being involved in this exhibition and the events surrounding it. We’ll be hearing more from them later about different activities going on in D.C. during the run of the show. I recommend connecting with them if you live locally or will be in town.\n\nVolunteering\n\nIf you’re a D.C. local or will be in town long enough to pull some volunteer shifts, the Renwick has a short-term exhibition volunteer call-out on their website. Shifts are four hours, and these opportunities are a maximum of 30 days.\n\nIn-Town Visitors / Anyone Physically Going to the Renwick\n\nIf you’ll be in town to visit the museum, I challenge you to think about how you can embody Burning Man while you’re there. I don’t necessarily mean wearing a costume (although if you’re a costume person, the Renwick folks tells me it’s welcome and encouraged). I mean, act as if you’re at Burning Man. Talk to strangers — in line, in the museum, when you’re out in the Golden Triangle seeing the larger sculptures in the neighborhood. Share your experiences. Ask people their thoughts. Be excellent to each other. The majority of the people who come to this show will have never been to Burning Man — can you imagine treating them like honored guests in our culture, and showing them why you enjoy this whole crazy thing?\n\nRemote Participation\n\nNot everyone can (or will want to) get to D.C. for the exhibition, but there are ways you can participate from afar. The Renwick has a social media screen in the museum, and they’ll be showing images hashtagged #NoSpectators from Instagram — images of the show taken by participants, but also the results of various image call-outs posted on Instagram. There will be themed requests for images of various objects and experiences from Burning Man and Regional Events.\n\nEvents List\n\nHere are some of the scheduled events so far (with more to come, check back on the Renwick’s page for upcoming events and the Golden Triangle’s events page):\n\nMarch 29, 7:30 p.m. – Opening Party – SOLD OUT\n\nMarch 30, 11:00 a.m. – Walking Tour of No Spectators: Beyond the Renwick\n\nMarch 30, noon – 2:00 p.m. – Open House\n\nApril 25, noon – Gallery Talk with Nora Atkinson\n\nMay 3, 8:00 p.m. – Artist Talk with David Best\n\nMay 18, noon – Walking Tour of No Spectators: Beyond the Renwick\n\nMay 25, noon – No Spectators-inspired Renwick Handi-Hour crafting at Farragut Park\n\nTop photo by Tristan Savatier",
