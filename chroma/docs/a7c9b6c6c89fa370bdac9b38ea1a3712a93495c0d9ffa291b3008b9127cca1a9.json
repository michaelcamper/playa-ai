  "content": "Ok, so the word for today was hot.\n\nI mean, hot hot.\n\nI mean, really really goddamn hot. And you know what? It’s cooled off since yesterday.\n\nYesterday it was 108 degrees in the shade. Some say 109, some say 107, so we’ll go with the average. It was hot yesterday, and it was hot today. Sun beating down on your head and shoulders hot, and oh by the way, there is no pool. No beach.\n\nThere were warnings at the DPW meeting this morning to watch out for each other. “If one of you breaks yourself, the whole crew suffers.”\n\nSo the word went out that electrolytes were available, and to watch out for each other, and to watch for the signs of heat exhaustion. The question was put to the assembled group: What ARE the signs of heat exhaustion?\n\n“Irritability!” someone shouted, irritably.\n\n—\n\nOf course, it might not just be heat exhaustion that causes irritability. I mean, this is a group of people who labors all day long in the sun, and again I mean realllly labors — digging, pounding, dragging, hammering, bending, you name it — and then at night carries on whole lot more. There might be a few PBRs consumed. There might be some Jameson quaffed. There also might be stories told in the morning about puking the night before.\n\nAnd yet there they all are at the morning meeting, getting word about what’s on tap for the day. At 7:30 in the morning, and that’s AFTER breakfast. This is a tough crew.\n\n—\n\nEvery day it starts to look more and more like there’s a big deal going on in the desert. You come out of Empire at night now, and you can see the line of lights out there in the middle of the desert floor where there wasn’t anything before. A city is taking shape. … It’s just a shell of what it WILL be, of course, but already it’s a whole lot of light where there wasn’t any before.\n\nAnd in the daytime, you can see the line of tents and trucks and RVs and STUFF out on the desert floor. There’s something big about to happen, you can tell, even if you’ve never heard of Burning Man.\n\n—\n\nIt should go without saying by now, but we’ll say it again anyway. The sheriffs are lying in wait for you, so SLOW DOWN when you come through the small towns. I saw another car pulled over outside Empire yesterday afternoon. Hi, welcome to Empire. That’ll be $200 or whatever. Seriously. Watch the speed limit signs.\n\nAnd if you’re coming out to the playa at night, watch for a bunch of other stuff, too. Like, kamikaze jackrabbits and field mice. Well, watch for them, but I wouldn’t recommend swerving to avoid them. The highway has brutally steep shoulders, and it’s not worth flipping your car for the sake of a jackrabbit who needs a lesson in Darwinism. But there are a lot of critters out there, including coyotes, too. But the coyotes are a lot smarter; they’ll be slinking off into the shadows by the time your car headlights catch up with them.\n—\n\nBacon is served pretty much every morning at breakfast. I’ve taken to eating it pretty much every morning. For the SALT content, of course! Oh, and maybe the protein. Bacon and fruit. Breakfast of champions.\n\n—\n\nSo another big topic at the morning meeting, besides the heat, was  the cellphone situation.\n\nWhat you might have heard by now is actually true. There IS cellphone service on the playa. It’s not just in Gerlach. It’s also available out in the desert, at least some of the time.\n\nWe were talking to Camera Girl, and she said a private outfit leased some land out near the Frog Pond and has installed a tower that is providing service to the playa. It has nothing to do with Burning Man. The Burning Man people are not behind it.\n\nThere were a lot of boos and hisses when Logan said he heard his phone making the familiar sound that he had a text message. “I looked down, and I had four bars!” he said. Someone in the crowd shouted, “I had five!” Someone else shouted, “Call me later!”\n\nBut it’s an interesting development, obviously. … You are no longer officially “out of reach” when you come to Burning Man. You can’t tell the office, or your significant others, “Hey, sorry, you won’t be able to get a hold of me.”\n\nOf course, you have to remember that no one comes to Burning Man for “a solitary experience,” as E put it. I mean, if you want to get away from it all and be out of reach, this is not the place. This is a very social setting.\n\nBut still, cellphones will change everything. (There’s a lot of thought that after the first couple of hours after the gates open, the service will be overwhelmed and no one will be able to use the phones anyway, so it may be much ado about not much.)\n\nI thought  Camera Girl had a pretty good common-sense take on the whole thing when she said, “My phone has an off button, and I know how to use it.”\n\nAnd I thought Blondie, from the Center Camp crew, had a good point too when he said that if you’re always able to be in touch with your group out here, if you never get lost and find yourself wandering around all alone, you’ll never have some of the unbelievably random but happy coincidences that happen when you’re forced to be off by yourself.\n\nAnd I do think it’ll be weird if there are people walking around yakking on the phone. And I do NOT want to read Twitters or Tweets or Facebooks or anything else about what happens out here. I would not look on that as a good development at all. Annoying in the extreme for those people here and for the people back at home, IMHO.\n\n—\n\nTomorrow night (Saturday) is Early Burn, and everyone’s getting kind of excited. It’s Burning Man the way it used to be, at least in my imagination. A bunch of improvised wooden structures … oh, say, like something someone might have built in their back yard and hauled down to the beach … will be torched for the general entertainment of the several hundred or so people who are out here now.\n\nIt’ll be small. There will be no giant sound systems. You might even have met the people standing nearby before. It will be on a decidedly smaller scale than what happens two weeks from Saturday. (Holy crap. Two weeks? Two more weeks before the Man burns? That is both an incredibly short period of time, and also an absolute eternity …)\n\nAnyway. The Little Man burns (or the Little Men and Women and Other Stuff burns) tomorrow night. There will also be a costume party. You are supposed to come dressed as your favorite DPW character. (There are no lack of them.) So have some fun with that.\n\nAnd one final word: when you see the pyrotechnic people running … it would be wise for you to start running, too.\n\nBurn it down.",
