  "content": "Burning Man Arts — the new department combining the Black Rock City Art Department with the Black Rock Arts Foundation (BRAF) — will launch a new online system in mid-November designed to make it easier for artists to apply for honoraria grants for art destined for Black Rock City.\n\nThis year, applicants will be required to first submit a Letter of Inquiry (LOI), which will allow the Grant Committee to select which projects will be invited to participate in the full grant application process, saving everybody time and effort.\n\nThe system will go live in mid-November, and LOI submissions will be accepted for four weeks. The Grant Committee aims to inform artists if they are invited to participate in the full grant application process by the beginning of 2015.\n\nAll artists hoping to receive a Black Rock City honorarium will need to participate in this new LOI process.\n\nMore information will be made available via the Jackrabbit Speaks and on the Burning Man Arts web pages as the rollout approaches.",
