  "content": "Not a big deal — but San Francisco passengers on the Burner Express Bus departing Saturday, August 26 need to know they will now depart from 200 McAllister Street, approximately one block north of the original location.\n\nThe change — for one day only — is to accommodate crowds attending the Peace, Music and Laughter festival. Saturday riders should arrive at least 90 minutes before departure and plan for large crowds and little parking in the area. The Saturday location has a much smaller loading zone.\n\nWe apologize for the last-minute notice and ask for everyone’s patience.\n\nThis change only applies to Saturday, August 26. For Sunday and beyond, all other Burner Express Bus riders will embark from the original location on Fulton Street between Hyde and Larkin Streets.",
