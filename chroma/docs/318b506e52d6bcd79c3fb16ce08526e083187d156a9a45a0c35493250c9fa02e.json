  "content": "It was a bitch and a bear on Thursday. Wednesday night might have been one of the most beautiful nights in the history of the playa (and yeah, given that this desert lakebed has been virtually unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years, that’s quite a statement), but Mother Nature and Mr. Blowhard Wind reminded us the next day that no, it’s really not all that hospitable here.\n\nThursday afternoon, the dust was blowing so hard it hurt. Movement was impossible. The tents of a lot of veteran burners, people who’ve been doing this awhile and know the drill, got shredded. (Which made for interesting improvised sleeping arrangements, but that’s another story entirely.)\n\nTheme camps are moving onto the playa in force, and artists are busting hump to finish their installations before the event begins. There’s activity all over the playa, and it’s filling up fast.\n\nThere’s lot’s to report, and we’ll be back in a bit with more.",
