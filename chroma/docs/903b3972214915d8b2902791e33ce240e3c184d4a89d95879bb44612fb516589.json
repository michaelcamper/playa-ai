I actually enjoyed the familiar FOMO feeling. Personally, I focused a few physical and digital expressions for Burn Week:\n\nI’m super inspired by how people Burned around the world. Don’t get me wrong…I REALLY want to go back to Black Rock City, but it is nice to know that the magic is not location-dependent.\n\nFeatured image photos by Julie Bergmans, Kellie Peckman & Atrina Brill",
