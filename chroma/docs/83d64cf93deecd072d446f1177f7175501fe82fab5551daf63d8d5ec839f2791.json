  "content": "The BLM has issued its Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for Burning Man. Unfortunately, the operational mitigations it outlines would fundamentally change the cultural fabric of Black Rock City. Read this post, which provides a high-level overview of the situation, highlighting that while Burning Man Project has been and will remain committed to its legacy of safety and strong environmental stewardship, many of these mitigations are unreasonable, untenable, arbitrary and capricious, attempt to solve problems that don’t exist, and/or create new (and worse) problems. We need your help.\n\nWe need everyone — particularly business owners, civic leaders, and subject matter experts — to provide substantive comments about these mitigations. By law, these comments must be taken into consideration by BLM in their drafting of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which will directly affect the future and survival of our event. Following are guidelines on how to submit high-quality, effective comments about the DEIS mitigations.\n\nHow to Submit a Comment\n\nBLM has requested public comment and we encourage everyone to review the Draft EIS and submit informed, substantive comments through the BLM’s comment form OR email blm_nv_burningmaneis@blm.gov. Be sure to copy/cc us at eis@burningman.org. The deadline for public comment is April 29. You may submit multiple comments on different issues or include many issues in a single comment. More details are on the BLM website.\n\nHow to Submit an Effective Comment\n\nThe most effective comments provide useful information to the BLM. DEIS comments are not counted as votes, nor are they part of a referendum on BLM decisions. They’re used to improve the document and analyses, ensuring impacts are adequately determined before the BLM makes a final decision on the proposed project. So, avoid comments like “I am in favor of this project” or “I am opposed to this project.”\n\nRemember: the more clear, concise, and relevant to the DEIS your comments are, the more effective they’ll be and the more likely it is that they’ll be utilized to improve the final documents and affect the agency’s decisions. The most effective comments should follow these guidelines:\n\nComments that simply reflect an opinion about the project will not be as effective. For example, a comment that states, “I don’t like the idea of concrete barriers around the event,” or “ I oppose putting dumpsters on Gate Road on principle” typically result simply in a response of “Comment Noted.” An effective comment might start with: “Concrete barriers would be detrimental to the Burning Man event because ___,” or “The event would be negatively affected by dumpsters on Gate Road because ___.”\n\nSubstantive comments that are backed by factual support sometimes lead to changes in the Final EIS and in the project. The comments should be written in a manner that requires the lead agency that designed the mitigation to actually respond.\n\nTo have a significant impact on the Draft EIS process, comments should point out errors, inconsistencies, omissions of data or analyses, or conclusions not based on evidence.\n\nThe agency needs to respond adequately to such substantive comments prior to certification of the final EIS. Failure to do so would provide the basis for a legal challenge to a certified (approved) EIS, and if the court agreed with the challenge, the EIS would be found invalid. in Black Rock City, outlining a series of operational mitigations that ostensibly ensure our event remains in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).\n\nWe have some of the world’s most brilliant and creative minds in the Burning Man community — let’s go! Thank you for your time in supporting this effort.\n\nThis post contains our analysis of all of the mitigations proposed in Appendix E, as well as background context to help you understand the history behind each. This will serve as helpful background as you craft your comments, so keep an eye out for it.\n\nFor more detailed guidelines, see these resources:\n\n[Editor’s Note: some of these guidelines are sourced directly from the BLM’s commenting tips.]\n\nTop photo by Mark Hammon",
