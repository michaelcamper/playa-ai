  "content": "Two years ago we literally didn’t want to know, and now we’re taking it head on: the total climate change impact, or carbon footprint, of Burning Man 2007 is 27,000 TONS. That’s everything as best we could figure it out–travel, fire art, everything. Wow. That’s a lot of pollution.\n\nTo fully embrace the “Leave No Trace” ethic means more than just keeping the playa clean. It also means paying the full price of attending the event. And now we know how much that is.\n\nSo, Burning Man is supporting the Cooling Man project. It’s as simple and elegant as their newly redesigned web page. Figure out what your share of the event is, then either take actions or make contributions to offset it.\n\nThis site is PACKED with great info. For example, did you know that all the fire art on the playa generates only 1% of the carbon impact of Burning Man? I didn’t, either. Or that if 70% of burners offset one ton of carbon then Black Rock City would be the first carbon negative city in the world? Ditto.\n\nIf you’re already convinced, and want to get right to figuring out how you can help, click here to go direct to the Cooling Man site.\n\nWant to know more? C’mon after the jump.\n\nSo, wondering “hey, what’s a carbon footprint anyway?” then click here, or here, or here for more info.\n\nNot everyone agrees with the idea of carbon offsets. Many people believe they’re a form of indulgences, purchased to offset guilt while not changing behavior. If behavior weren’t changing, we might agree, but as part of a comprehensive plan to take on an incredibly complicated issue, we say right on.\n\nSome of you have questions, no doubt, I’ll do my best to answer a couple obvious ones:\n\nQ: Will we still be burning the man?\n\nA: Don’t worry, it’s still Burning Man, not Composting Dude. We’re still going to have the big fire in the desert. Only now, we’ll be cleaning up a bit more completely afterwards.\n\nQ: So Burning Man the org’s share is 6%-what are you doing to offset it?\n\nA: switching 11,000 gallons of fuel to biodiesel, running the entire man complex on solar power, using better power management, and encouraging conservation in every aspect of the event, are just a few things we’ll be doing. Will it add up to 6%? We’re not sure, but there is someone doing a baseline environmental assessment of the event, and they’ll be capturing this info and we’ll share it when it’s ready. We’re definitely leaning toward the doing and not paying side ( you know, the whole participation and immediacy thing).\n\nQ: What’s Cooling Man going to do with the donations they receive?\n\nA: I’ll copy directly from their website at length, but in brief: they’ll use it to build new, clean, greener energy. Here’s the copy:\n\nCoolingMan aggregates donations from participants and obtains offsets from new renewable energy or other emission-reducing projects. We seek projects that advance a variety of technologies and deliver sustainable development co-benefits. CoolingMan’s porftolio includes non-CO2 offsets to support a range of technology options, match emission profiles, and achieve rapid benefits.\n\nCoolingMan invests in the following types of GHG offset projects:\n\nWant more factiods?
