  "content": "The fabulous John Curley has been keeping you up to date on all the crews and artists getting the Black Rock Desert ready to Welcome you. You have probably read his post about the recent  storms, and perhaps another on the way. My husband has been on the desert for a few weeks so I had been wondering about the damage, whether his trailer was anchored down, and how everyone who is building the city would be impacted by the weather.  And then my friend Sidney Erthal sent me this amazing photo of BELIEVE.\n\nThe “V” in BELIEVE was tilted by the storm, but had the “E” next to it to lean on. But, as you can see,  the “I” had fallen over, but there, in the morning after the storm, stood Truth is Beauty, standing taller than the “I”, just like she knew she needed to be there. Now that is a moment after a storm to make you smile.\n\nBELIEVE: Laura Kimpton and Jeff Schomberg as part of The Large Word Series\n\nTruth Is Beauty: Marco Cochrane and Crew as part of of The Bliss Project\n\nPhoto: Sidney Erthal Photography",
