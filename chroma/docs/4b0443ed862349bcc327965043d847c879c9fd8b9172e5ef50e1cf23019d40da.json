  "content": "If I had an intern, or a ghost writer, or even another fifteen minutes, this space would be occupied by poignant observations, a vague reference towards the weather, a witty quip about Burners and their general resilience to adversity, and finish with a snarky zinger. But…it’s sunset, the light is great, I’m going out to shoot, so let’s get down to it!\n\nThe Man\n\nEmbrace, by the Pier Group\n\nThe Temple of Grace, by David Best\n\nAnd last but not least, El Pulpo Mechanico…\n\nStuff is exploding outside, gotta go. More  either late tonight, or early tomorrow.",
