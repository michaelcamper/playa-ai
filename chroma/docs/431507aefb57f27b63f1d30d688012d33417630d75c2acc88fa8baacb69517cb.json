  "content": "A couple dozen or so people rode down to the Gates last evening for the “soft” opening of Burning Man 2011.\n\nAs you’ve no doubt heard, the gates to the city don’t open until midnight on Sunday night of the event. Buuuuut, for the last couple of years, there has in fact been an unofficial official opening, when the powers that be have said that it’s time to let folks in and get those lines moving.\n\nThere are already a LOT of people here; as of about 2pm on Monday, there were officially 15,431 people in Black Rock City. That number is not an exact one: it’s the average of the population in the past 24 hours, so we can assume that there are at least several thousand more than that here now.\n\nMost of those here have early arrival passes, so they can set up their camps and their art. But as of last night at 6:30, all were welcome.\n\nGerbil was one shift commander at the Gate last evening, and he popped up on top of a container, waved his arms, and the influx commenced. Many people had been waiting in line for hours already, but in general the mood was festive.\n\nMany of the Gate workers were wearing clown makeup. Why was that? “You don’t want to f— with a clown,” MissFit said. Gerbil had another explanation: “It’s a f— circus out here!”\n\nStill, working the gate is a tough task. You have to be friendly, but firm. You have to get a look at the tickets, but more importantly maybe, you have to check to make sure that there isn’t any contraband being smuggled into the city, humans included.\n\nAnd not everyone about to begin their Burn is in the greatest mood. “I had one guy calling me a ….” Vasha was saying. And she wasn’t alone in her complaints about rough treatment.\n\nOne Gate worker’s playa name explains it all: it’s Kiosk. And they earned the name when they were pinned between a car and a kiosk.\n\nLater last night, around midnight, a much larger group of BRC residents went down to the Gates to welcome the new arrivals. There were bullhorns and beers and rolling in the dust as the “official” Opening Night party got underway.\n\nEither way, early or late, it’s really official now: It has begun!",
