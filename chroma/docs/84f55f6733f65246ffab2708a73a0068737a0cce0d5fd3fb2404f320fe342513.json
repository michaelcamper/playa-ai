  "content": "It’s no small feat, building a city. The people who come together to begin surveying and raising Black Rock City know intimately the joy, the gravity and significance of what we create together. Yesterday, July 27, 2023 a small group of city builders came together to hammer the first spike — known as the Golden Spike — into the epicenter of Black Rock City.\n\nOn this spike, the Man will rise. And from it will emanate the entirety of Black Rock City — from the Temple, to the Esplanade, and all the way back to Kraken street. As soon as the spike is in the ground (following a celebration, of course) the Survey team begins. They’re already out there today, plotting the lines that will define the grid of our ephemeral city.\n\nDay by day, person by person, from this moment, Black Rock City comes to life.\n\nWe can’t wait to welcome you Home.\n\nRead on to hear from some of the city builders who participated in this year’s Golden Spike.\n\n“At the end of the day, so much of what brings meaning and compelling moments to Burning Man are the rituals. It is about ritual. It just made me reflect on a lot of my time that I spent and what I’ve both given and gotten from the event. It just brought this home to this one moment, and it all starts here, with a little hammer and spike.\n\n“I also have to say this year felt different…  Right now, in and around Gerlach, as more Burning Man folks are showing up and at this ceremony and in the celebration afterwards, it just felt lighter. It felt like there was more joy in the air and positive anticipation. It’s almost like this is the return to Black, Rock City that we were hoping for last year. This year it feels like it’s that.” – Patrice ‘Chef Juke’ Mackey, Department of Mutant Vehicles Council Member\n\n“How does one set an intention for culture to thrive? The design of Black Rock City would not have become the plans for the city without starting at a single point. Setting pencil to paper to create the design would then translate into cracking the surface of the playa to physically create the survey of Black Rock City.\n\n“What began as a starting point for the survey of Black Rock City became a ceremony, a ritual of the Golden Spike, created by Will Roger and Tony ‘Coyote’ Perez for the Department of Public Works. Over the years, this gesture of appreciation shows those in attendance — those who take a swing at the Gold Spike — that the rewarding hard work ahead of them will promote creative inspiration.\n\n“Today on the Black Rock Desert nearly 200 people gathered around that single point, to continue that ritual, each in turn taking a swing with the sledge hammer aiming for the Golden Spike. Black Rock City has begun!” – Crimson Rose, Cultural Co-founder\n\n“It still astounds me that we take a complete blank canvas and spin out the wheel of an entire city. It demonstrates just what cities are made of — it shows how the spokes of structure can bring the heart of community. And it happens in the spirit of immediacy — it chimes from the moment that spike taps the playa.\n\n“This year has the feel of an engine that got its tune up — all pistons firing after a clunky year — even the playa seems healed and firm — spirits high.” – Tony ‘Coyote’ Perez, Black Rock City Superintendent\n\n“In the morning, we gathered for a blessing ceremony with Dean Barlese, an elder of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. We stood in a circle where the Man will stand. The sun was already strong, and the distant peaks surrounding the playa were colorful. Dean led the blessing, and Misty Youngbear’s son Harrison (Meskwaki/Omaha) did the smudging for each of the members of our group. Many of us shared thoughts about this place, and Will Roger led us in a pledge of allegiance to Mother Earth. We’re honored to continue this new tradition that we started together last year.” – Marnee Benson, Director of Government Affairs\n\n“We’re very aware that we’re creating the playground for people to come in and play. It’s up to them to like their experience, and we’re hoping it’s a good one. We’re hoping it’s the thing that attracted all of us.\n\n“I think this is my 23rd Golden Spike. This is my 19th year managing Resto, and I’m just like, ‘Wow. This is the circle that welcomed me when I was the new kid.’\n\n“We circle around and then the people who hit the spike address the circle of people. The community and people really thank one another. They thank each other for their work. Sometimes people go into a little bit of a personal story, what this means to them or why it was tough for them to get here, or what kind of year they just had and it just gets witnessed. And then they declare something… their love or for the community or whatever it is, and then hit the spike. So there’s a lot of intention and love that gets driven to that first point of the city.” – Dominic ‘DA of Black Rock’ Tinio, Playa Restoration Manager\n\n“For DPW it’s the start of the city. It’s the beginning of Survey. It’s the center point where the Man stands. It’s the ceremonial and spiritual groundbreaking for building Black Rock City. My husband [Tony ‘Coyote’ Perez], has chosen since they were born to include my boys in the ceremonial aspect of that. It’s really special to me in a way that connects our family to our history here.” – Melissa ‘Hormel’ Waters, DPW veteran and herbalist, San Francisco Office Administrator",
