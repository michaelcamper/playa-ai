That’s so cool!” is the most common reply. “What’s that like?” And I go on to explain that it’s just like going as an adult — there are highs and lows but overall it’s so worth it.\n\nOther times people are aghast, not understanding how this could possibly be an appropriate family vacation. The concern usually comes from people who’ve never been to Burning Man or don’t know that there’s actually a vibrant community of parents and kids on the playa, concentrated in the large camp called Kidsville.\n\nThe good people of Kidsville are pros when it comes to preparing for a family trip to Black Rock City.\n\nSo to help those of you who are bringing their kids for the first time, we polled Kidsville for advice on surviving playa life with the whole family, both physically and mentally.\n\nThanks so much to the following Burners: Ron Fitzherbert from Las Cruces, NM; Howard Gibbs-Hobgood from NYC; Jesper from Oakland; FunGuy, Boss Lady, Aquagirl, 5K, Fiesta River Runner from Sebastopol, CA; Marie from Reno; Mel Holmes from San Diego; Dean Velasco from San Diego; Mackenzie Rain from Caspar, CA; Maya from Glendale, NY; Day from Oakland; Ruby and Fat Chance from Groton, MA.\n\nHere is their collective wisdom, distilled into handy lists and notes for your packing and preparation pleasure.\n\n(Please note that this advice focuses on children, and not on teens. Taking teenagers to Burning Man naturally evokes a new range of insights, which is a great topic for another post…Anyone? :))\n\nWhy Take Kids at All\n\nThe reasons why people take their kids to Burning Man are as common as “Well, of course, I’d take my kids on vacation!” to a more intentional desire for children to see this world firsthand.\n\nThis desire includes everything from teaching survival skills and leaving the comfort zone of home to showing alternate ways of living as a community, interacting with strangers, and celebrating creativity and self-expression. “Plus, Burner kids are the coolest people we know,” observe Ruby and Fat Chance.\n\nWhat to Bring\n\nPacking is a very personal thing, and it goes without saying that kids need the same basic items you’d bring for an adult — food, water, shelter, and a few things for fun. The goal of packing for your brood is to bring “things that protect them from the elements and make them feel at home”, says Maya of Glendale.\n\nFood Tips\n\nHydration Tips\n\nShelter, Cooling and Protection Tips\n\nClothing Tips\n\nBike & Playa Transport Tips\n\nNice-to-haves\n\nHow to talk to your kids about what they’ll see\n\nThis is another highly personal thing, but these explanations might come in handy when preparing your wee ones for playa life.\n\nHave conversations with your kids before you go, show them pictures and videos to get excited, and invite them to share their questions and concerns before you leave so you have a good handle on what might come up when you’re there.\n\nMaya of Glendale even took her son to a regional event before the big Burn. “That made him understand the Burning Man principles better,” she said.\n\nHere are some of the conversations that other parents have already had:\n\nThings we wish someone told *us* before our first time\n\nHindsight is always 20/20. Parents said they wish they knew the following before their family’s Burning Man baptism:\n\nOther tips and parting advice\n\nTop photo by Zipporah Lomax",
