  "content": "Flame bearing firewalker\nentering my dreams-\nclad in leather garments-\nclinging, revealing every seam so as to\nbe seen more fully naked for the clothing\nwhich accentuates-\neach rivulet of sweat beading in hair and dripping\ndown cheeks-\n\nIntensity of jugglers set rhythmically to flame-\n\nDance for the man-\nDance while he burns-\nChant for the man as the crowd turns tight and\npresses in to release life in strong thrown gestures-\n\nMan made lightning striking-\nheart burning-\nrib cage slowly oscillating swing while we all\nclimb aboard-\ndrums banging into the night next to laser lit\nstreaming silk cocoon and the wind restructuring\nenvirons to its will-\n\nInvite me back barren plain- invite me back to dream-\n\nWelcome Home.\n\nby Andy Taylor",
