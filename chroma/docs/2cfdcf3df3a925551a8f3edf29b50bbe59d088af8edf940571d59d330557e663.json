This program is just one of the many ways the global nonprofit Burning Man Project amplifies creative expression in BRC and beyond.\n\nThis is only the beginning of the magic and wonder that arise from artists uniting their friends, families, and communities to bring their wildest creative dreams to life. So buckle up and join us as we embark on a journey filled with art, innovation, audacious creativity, and the power of human connection!\n\nMore Money for Art!\n\nThe annual budget for the Honoraria Program art grants was last increased — to $1.2M — in 2018. In recent years, the economic climate has posed significant challenges, with artists experiencing rising costs and a decrease in their fundraising capabilities. Thanks to the generosity of numerous donors who have demonstrated their passion for art in Black Rock City, we are thrilled to share that we’ve been able to increase Honoraria funding by an additional $100,000, for an annual total of $1.3M — that is what we like spending money on!\n\nThis year, we received 547 Letters of Intent, and invited 375 projects to submit full proposals. We are delighted to announce that 76 projects will receive funding for Black Rock City in 2024, promising another year of memorable art installations.\n\nThe Selection Process\n\nWhen selecting Honoraria projects, our focus extends beyond individual value judgments in order to prioritize crafting a holistic experience as diverse as the citizens of BRC. Rather than selecting the “best” artworks — which is of course very subjective — we curate a collection that encompasses a broad spectrum of aesthetics, vibes, and experiences.\n\nOur goal is to embrace the rich diversity of our community and the various ways art facilitates participation. We consider families, fire enthusiasts, climbers, those that need to take a pause and have a seat, a melange of global cultures, lovers of stories, treasure hunters, rock ‘n’ rollers, meditators, bicyclists who delight in weaving through art installations, and everyone in between.\n\nWe aim to ensure the Honoraria collection represents a variety of scale and scope, as well as diverse concepts, ranging from whimsical and playful to thought-provoking. We look for fiery spectacles and dazzling lighting, as well as serene and contemplative oases. We welcome novel interpretations of the annual theme and artworks that transcend thematic boundaries. Throughout the selection process, we prioritize core criteria such as interactivity, visual appeal, impact, and sheer creativity, while offering support to both emerging and experienced artists. Finally, we are committed to celebrating diversity and encouraging environmental sustainability.\n\nAs technology evolves, we recognize the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in image creation and written materials in grant applications. AI is another tool in an artist’s toolkit, and we are mindful to consider things like, “Will it actually look like that?” or “Is this really feasible to construct?” We investigate artists’ past work to help gauge feasibility. And sometimes we take calculated risks, understanding that we are investing in an artist and their community as much as their artwork.\n\n2024 Theme — Curiouser and Curiouser\n\nEvery year, the playa’s blank canvas undergoes a remarkable transformation, blossoming into a fantastical wonderland of creativity and imagination. This year’s theme offered artists an extra dose of inspiration, igniting a spark of curiosity and encouraging them to delve into the realm of exploration and wonder.\n\nThe open playa will contain an abundance of experiences designed to disorient and dazzle our perceptions. While “Tempus Turibulum, the Time Burner” might keep you punctual with fire poofers, Andrea Greenlees and Andy Tibbetts are hoping to trigger the death of all clocks and declare a forever Teatime with their project, “The End of Time.”\n\nBlack Rock City is an ideal place for artists to experiment with scale, offering another way to challenge perception. “Banana for Scale” brings the popular meme to the playa with a 30’ long banana that seems destined to make it into the subreddit /r/BananasForScale. A larger-than-life dryer, “Sock-o-tron 4200” welcomes participants inside to spin the drum like a human hamster wheel, activating an immersive “drying” effect.\n\nSeveral projects harness the power of collective participation to create topsy-turvy interactions. “Interlace” features three hyperboloids that participants spin to unlock a trippy illusion, while “The (Im)possible Dialogue,” presents a circle of heads that can be rotated to harmonize sound and lighting. “Kaleidoscope Hole” is made of three tall, rotatable rings that form a kaleidoscopic tunnel pointed at the Man; prepare to tumble down a rabbit hole of wonder. Additionally, Rebekah Waites’ “Relevé Ladies” creates the illusion of spinning dresses, which appear to defy gravity.\n\nThe curiosity and wonder behind this year’s theme are widespread. You might experience a shocking surprise if you are curious enough to play with “Bad Hatter,” a giant top hat that contains percussive solenoid instruments. Chinese artist Miao He, who brought the pink bunny in 2023, returns with a 26-foot tall mushroom, “Mona Mushroom.” An old favorite that hasn’t been to BRC since 2018 is returning with some upgrades — “Radial Sonic Runway” will make an excellent Wonderland of light in motion.\n\nOther Highlights and Themes\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2022 and 2023 were a time to collectively process the emotions arising from global uncertainty, both within and beyond Black Rock City. And like a pendulum, sentiments have shifted; we found a sense of lightheartedness in many of the art concepts this year. While the world certainly isn’t all unicorns and rainbows right now, the open playa may evoke a playful, whimsical vibe in 2024. We are so ready for some fun, and it appears many artists are too.\n\nThe projects this year include not one, not two, but THREE projects featuring unicorns! “Dream Slide” invites participants to slide down a unicorn’s mane, “Monoceros” delves into unicorn lore aboard a gilded boat with a unicorn at the prow. “The Purple Unicorn” is a fiberglass sculpture paying homage to American hot rod culture with a dazzling custom paint finish. And “Polychroma” features a shimmering rainbow, representing a multicolored approach to beauty, diversity, strength, justice, and ecological health.\n\nSpeaking of rainbows, there are a number of projects that embrace a vibrancy of color to catch your eye. “Promise of the Century” invites interaction with prismatic elements to create rainbow light. Patrick Shearn’s “Sky Gazing” will beckon you to look up at a canopy of colorful fabric ribbons spanning 400 feet and hovering 60 feet in the air. And we are very excited about “The Mothership Connection” by Zak Ové, which blends Pacific Northwest totem making, African and Caribbean cultural traditions, and Afrofuturism. This project comes with support from Project Aikido, an organization with the goal of bringing African art and music to Burning Man.\n\nA maritime theme sets sail with boats, coral, a sea serpent, and even a pile of treasures, which will make an excellent backdrop for a flash mob of pirates or a chorus of sea shanties reveling on the ancient Lake Lahontan. Notably, “Naga and the Captainness” is led by a team of women artists who are impressively experienced builders. They are creating a sea serpent and shipwreck scene with an abundance of delightful elements to explore.\n\nBurning Man is known for fire art, and 2024 will be no exception. 17 Honoraria projects are planning to play with fire and flame effects. The Iron Monkeys are bringing another stunning project, “Glimmer,” a grand crown made of steel vines, vibrant resin flowers, and colorful gems that will come to life at night with flame effects. Our tallest Honoraria project, “Coney McConeface: The Life and Death of a Traffic Cone” elevates a basic traffic cone to a 60-foot-tall towering shrine of safety that will go up in flames. “Goa Gil Farewell Darshan” celebrates Black Rock City’s electronic music origins by paying tribute to Goa Gil, one of the founders of the Goa trance and psytrance movement. Goa Gil, who passed away last October, DJed at Burning Man’s first rave-style sound camp in 1992.\n\nTwo additional “fire” projects are exploring a more sustainable way to burn with artificial fire. “Camp-Fire” will use programmable LEDs and sensors to mimic one of the first places where people would gather and connect — around a fire. “Styx and Stones” is an immersive installation of “fire”: a 90’ long realistic river of flickering flames made from billowing hand-cut silks, with a glowing footbridge that beckons the brave to traverse its fiery embers. Now that we are coming up on five years since publishing our 2030 Environmental Sustainability Roadmap, we are pleased to report that 41% of the Honoraria projects demonstrated a significant effort towards sustainability in their proposals, via innovative solutions to power, materials, and transport, or the artwork’s message. That is up by more than 17% over last year!\n\nIn addition to 18 states in the US, including the unincorporated territory Puerto Rico, we’re pleased to include 12 international Honoraria projects this year. There are two from the United Kingdom and one each from Belgium, China, Colombia, Estonia, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden. Some of the 2024 Honoraria artists have just started making art recently, while others have been contributing to the art at Burning Man for over 25 years. Four of this year’s Honoraria recipients will be coming to Black Rock City for the first time!\n\nThere’s so much to be excited about, and we can’t wait to share it all with you.\n\nHow You Can Get Involved\n\nIt’s important to note that the vast majority of the 400+ art installations in Black Rock City receive no financial support from Burning Man Project. Our commitment to supporting ALL artists runs deep, and we recognize that fostering a vibrant creative community goes beyond financial assistance. This includes offering access to heavy equipment, conducting engineering reviews, facilitating communications outreach, and providing partnerships with our team throughout the artistic journey. By leveraging our resources and expertise, we cultivate an environment where artists can thrive and bring their visions to life, enriching the collective experience in our city.\n\nCheck out the following list of 2024 BRC Honoraria projects, and if you have a vision that’s missing from the list, you are warmly invited to make it happen. Do you have skills to contribute and want to help an existing art project? Then please check out our collaboration tool Spark.\n\nWithout further ado, we’d like to introduce this year’s Honoraria recipients.\nDrum roll, please…\n\nThe 2024 Black Rock City Honoraria Recipients\n\nA Capsule of Curiosity — Andi Morency and The Gryphonart Collective – Honors Academy of Literature Student Artist Group — Reno, NV\n\nA Moment in an Aeon — Iyvone Khoo and Miguel Guzman — Joshua Tree, CA\n\nA Seat on the Throne — Chelsea Odufu — Newark, NJ\n\nAlways Another Sunrise — Chelsey Hathman — Oakland, CA\n\nAnti-Gravitational Chamber — Intergalactic Confederation — Grass Valley, CA\n\nApex of Azure — Anna Gribovsky — San Francisco, CA\n\nBad Hatter — Neil Mendoza and Winslow Porter and Birmingham!! — Albuquerque, NM; New York, NY\n\nBanana for Scale — Caroline Kamm — Brussels, Belgium\n\n¡¡¡¡Big Spinning Wheels!!!! — Josh Cohen and PDA — Roxbury, NY\n\nBlack Rock City Supper Club — Carlyn Perona King — Reno, NV\n\nCamp-Fire — Wilhelmus Vlug — Volendam, The Netherlands\n\nCarried by the Wind — Cameron Anne Mason and Dusty Nation — Seattle, WA\n\nCelestial Syzygy Garden — Shane Robinson and TRM Artistic Metal Creations — Dolan Springs, AZ\n\nConey McConeface: The Life and Death of a Traffic Cone — Chris Hankins and Conecophany Collective — Dargaville, New Zealand\n\nCOQUÍ — NiNo Alicea and The Parliament Art Crew — Los Angeles, CA; Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico\n\nDANCING BALLOON ROBOT — Sepehr Ghassemi and SEP GHAS — Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY; Seattle, WA; Tehran, Iran\n\nDesert Pop — Lance Dehne — Reno, NV\n\nDream Slide — William Nemitoff and Curious Form — New Orleans, LA\n\nEquinox of Curiosity — Candice Stewart and Cozy Torpedo — Asheville, NC\n\nFable Bound — Kyle Stewart and Build to Strike — Denver, CO\n\nGaia Weeps — Michael Malecki and Dmitriy Yastrebov — Grass Valley, CA; Bowling Green, KY\n\nGlimmer — Tabasco Mills and Iron Monkeys — Seattle, WA\n\nGoa Gil Farewell Darshan — Gaby Tello and Friends of Goa Gil — Oakland, CA\n\nHabitat — Mark Rivera and Kidnetick — Santurce, Puerto Rico\n\nH E A R T H — Mckenzie Genin and The Green Bucket Lab — Woodside, CA\n\nHeartless Dino — Arturo Gonzalez and Arte Conciencia — Saltillo, Mexico\n\nInterlace — Josh Zubkoff & Srikanth Guttikonda with Looking Up Arts — San Francisco, CA\n\nKaleidoscope Hole — Michaela Hares — Eugene, OR\n\nLight Curve — Sam Cooler with Art for Open Spaces — San Francisco, CA\n\nLive Dangerously, Carefully — Jamie Joyce — Berkeley, CA; Houston, TX\n\nLost in Thought — Matthew Schultz — Reno, NV\n\nMare — Francesco Campanella and OTG — Los Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL\n\nMariposa — Christopher Schardt — Oakland, CA\n\nMona Mushroom — Miao He and Promoting Art (PART) center — Hangzhou, China\n\nMonoceros — Harley Bergsma — Truth or Consequences, NM\n\nNaga and the Captainess — Cjay Roughgarden, Stephanie Shipman, Jackie Scott, and Crew, supported by Five Ton Crane — Oakland, CA\n\nNebula Shroom Grove — Silvia Rueda and Understory — Bogotá, Colombia; London, United Kingdom\n\nOgoh Ogoh The Karmic Questioner — I Wayan Sunarinta and The Karma Collective — Bali, Indonesia\n\nOrganic Study No. 4 — Luis Varela-Rico — Las Vegas, NV\n\nP.O.D.S.
