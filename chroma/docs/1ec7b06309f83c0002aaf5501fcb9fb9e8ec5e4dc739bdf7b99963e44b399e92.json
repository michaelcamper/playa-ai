  "content": "Was reading an article about Burning Man the other day where the writer remarks on how serious the participants can be about Black Rock City’s principle of “Leave No Trace”. He mentions a happening at a bar where someone flicks a cigarette butt down and the instant scolding he gets from his campmates. The writer also mentions how impressed he is with this because the playa was already protected with AstroTurf. Participants were so concerned with leaving no trace that they would never let it hit the ground even if it had a protective barrier on it.\n\nUpon reading this it occurred to me that people can think that putting down yards of AstroTurf in their camp will safeguard it from MOOP.\n\nThis year’s public service announcement:\n\nAstroTurf is MOOP!!\n\nAstroTurf is some of the worst and most difficult to get rid of MOOP ever, and more and more camps are using it.\n\nAstroTurf shreds and sheds worse than a dried up Christmas tree, and when you finally pull it up after an event’s worth of trampling and occasional soakings, there’s a billion little green plastic grass blades embedded into the hard pan playa. And this can stretch for a block’s worth sometimes.\n\nFor understandable reasons, AstroTurf is exponentially growing in popularity. It gives your camp a lush and dust-free floor, and I’m betting that many believe that it doubles as a MOOP catcher. Turns out that it’s a MOOP nightmare!\n\nWe all need to get the word out far and wide that AstroTurf is right up there with boa feathers, wood chips, and pistachio nut shells as “Worst MOOP Ever”.\n\nLeave no trace – leave no couch – leave no AstroTurf!!\nNever let it hit your pack job.\n\nASTRO – NOT!\n\nCoyote Nose",
