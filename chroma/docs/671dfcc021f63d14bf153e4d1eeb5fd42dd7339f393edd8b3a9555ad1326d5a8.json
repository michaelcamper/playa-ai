  "content": "Sometimes, when the citizens of Black Rock City are confronted with a challenge, they turn it into an art project. This, ladies and gentlemen, is one of those times.\n\nThe street signs that adorn every corner of BRC are not only beautiful, they’re functional. Not only are they functional, they are critical to public safety. When that ambulance is looking to find YOU, they need to know what street they’re on. SO DON’T REMOVE STREET SIGNS!\n\nNow, despite what we say, we know it’ll happen anyway. So let’s solve this with an art project! Here’s how …\n\nAdopt a street corner in your neighborhood, and add new, aesthetically pleasing, informative street signs of your own making! (Please don’t put stuff on the existing sign-posts, though.)\n\nWe’re calling this the Adopt a Street Sign (ASS) project, because we’re 12-years old.\n\nRadical Self-Expression, meet Communal Effort. BOOM. Make babies.\n\nLastly, Leave No Trace! Make sure to MOOP the street corners at the end of the event!!",
