  "content": "Can you remember where you were a year ago today? It’s been a wild year, with fires, hurricanes, national uprisings, a global pandemic, and an indescribable catalogue of feelings to accompany it all. It’s hard to believe that just last July, Burning Man Project published our 2030 Environmental Sustainability Roadmap, and now, as we approach the one-year anniversary, we are excited to report how far we’ve come and what steps we’re taking next.\n\nIn a year without Black Rock City, we’ve been offered a precious moment to pause and really look at the systems we have in place. In 2019 we set benchmarks for the first two years to measure and reduce impacts, consider offsets, and test pilot projects. We’ve not only started this work but accomplished even more, including a series of regenerative projects with Burners Without Borders.\n\nWe’ve got two exciting events coming up where you can get involved and be the first informed. We want your input, feedback and expertise:\n\nSo how can you participate? Register to join our July 17 community call on Kindling here and join the FB event here. If you can’t join us live, be on the lookout for the published report on July 20th, with links to the recording of the webinar.\n\nWe invite you to join us in a celebration of a whole lot of work done, share in the vision of a whole lot more work ahead, and get involved in mapping out the next steps of our collective vision for environmental sustainability.\n\nTop photo by Benjamin Slater",
