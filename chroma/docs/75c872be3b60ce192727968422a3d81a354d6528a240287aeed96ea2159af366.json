  "content": "Check out these pictures!\n\nFor a few years now I’ve been posting sporadically about the pinhole camera artists who produce some of the most amazing pictures to come out of Burning Man … and that’s saying a lot.\n\nThey needed the coverage, because despite being a (er, fairly) organized band with a recurring presence and even a little Burning Man staff support on the side, the pinhole camera artists never got their shit together enough to put up a web page.\n\nThey still haven’t.  But they’ve got a Facebook page.  And that Facebook page has some of their incredible work, and is a way you can connect with them if you want to help.\n\nAnd seriously – check this stuff out.  You want to help.",
