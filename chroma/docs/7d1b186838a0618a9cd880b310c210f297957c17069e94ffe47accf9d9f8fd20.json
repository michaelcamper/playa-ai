Each post lays out key concepts and practical examples intended to bring us closer to building Shirley Strong’s vision of Beloved Community, which is driven by a spiritually engaged activism to bring about a shared vision and a greater good. This is especially important at this time given the disconnection many of us are experiencing due to isolation from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs a global culture of creators and community engineers, many Burners are familiar with Shirley’s ideals; we may see them in our projects, events, and aspirations. The 10 Ingredients for Building Beloved Community and Creating Belonging — the first five are introduced below, with more introduced weekly on Hive — burnify the process of building Beloved Community and creating belonging by sharing stories and examples that reference our own experiences in Black Rock City and beyond.\n\nWe invite you to join us in reflecting on ways we integrate these ingredients into your life, creations, gatherings, and beyond.
