  "content": "Most of us are home and cleaning the playa dust from this year’s [BM].  My kitchen continues to smell like vinegar since my husband and I arrived home two weeks apart.  But most of my friends are talking about missing the community and spectacle they experience at the Burning Man event. For some of them, like us, it has become a part of their lives.  I know there are a lot of videos out there but I thought you might like to see “Burn Baby Burn”.  It does have some enhancements so if you are a purist about the Burn this might not be the video for you, but I loved it:\n\nMusic: BRAPT, an underground Belgian artist\nAnimation: John Ferran (Dustfish)\nVideo: Mister WA or MisterWAvideo@gmail.com",
