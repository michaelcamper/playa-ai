  "content": "This was my first year. I was so careful in my planning & research. I thought I had prepared myself as much as one could. Newbies! The Playa has her own plans for us. She decides what will happen. She is a living entity. I could feel her energy almost immediately.\n\nDay 2 I stopped trying to fight the dust as I realized it was a losing battle. I went ahead & breathed her into me. I ate the food she got on. I let her live on my skin. I became one with the Playa. The deeper I got- the more she showed me.\n\nOne evening while walking to my block from middle Playa, a little dust storm picked up. I braced my back against it, put my mask up & pointed my flashlight around to see how thick it would get. I told the Playa it looked like we were under water. She told me she was showing me how she used to look. She remembers when she wasn’t dry & dusty. She remembers when water & life were a part of her day to day. I fell totally in love with her that night.\n\nWhen people started packing & leaving, she was very sad. So sad- it was pulling me into the depression. I didn’t want to leave her alone but when the time came for me to leave, my RV wouldn’t start. I realized that we had to talk. I sat down put my hands on her & explained that I knew she missed hosting life & she looked forward to us coming home every year because for the shortest time she wasn’t alone & she was useful… almost like old days for her. I told her I loved her but that she had to let me go. I promised to always return to her & assured her that I knew this was now my home. The tow truck that had been blocked at the gate showed up shortly after.\n\nNext year- no planning! I know our beloved Playa is the one that spins the magic & I will dive right into her dust & let whatever she has planned for me happen.\n\nby Playalive",
