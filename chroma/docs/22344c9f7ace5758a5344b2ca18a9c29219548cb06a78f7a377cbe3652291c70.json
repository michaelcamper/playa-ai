  "content": "Beware of the Hungry Wind : Bring tethers, anchors, containers, and covers, to keep light stuff from blowing away. Tiny items that get wind born eventually stop tumbling, and when they do dust piles up against them, eventually forming mounds, then snakes, then berms, then hills, then mountain ranges, then…you get the idea. Even TINY stuff that blows away can have a large impact. And the wind gets greedy even when it’s not blowing–so when leaving Black Rock City, secure your load, and check it twice. Don’t be the one leaving “white people prayer flags” aka garbage twitering in the breeze along the highways home – Lorax",
