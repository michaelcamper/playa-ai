  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is back with a third season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS03 E01 – Not At All Inspiring: Answers From Ultra-Marathoners\n\nYou go from Pink Lightning camp to 7:00, then out to the Esplanade, and down to 10:00. At 10:00, turn left and go all the way out to the trash fence. You go along the trash fence passing 12:00, until you hit 2:00 on the trash fence. Hard right and run along 2:00 to Esplanade, take Esplanade to Center Camp, run up 6:00 or 6:30 back to Pink Lightning camp. That loop is seven miles. And if you’re doing the Burning Man Ultra Marathon, you can expect to loop that loop four times and then some. Also, the inherent awfulness of the Dewey Decimal System.\n\nS03 E02 – I’m Back to Anal Again\n\nAccuracy Third’s first on-playa interview from the 2017 Burn. Kink and sex positivity abound as we talk to Kit, ex-Greeter and current resident of a dungeon-lite camp. A moratorium on spanking. Human connection through hugging humans. Vacuuming the playa. Steampunk posers. Kitty dingo, Pizza Burrito, and the day after Rough Burn. Anal, ovbs. What makes a Burner? What makes Greeters unhappy? Do you remember Jiffy Lube or Leviticus? D-day is hoarse, Rex is an unreliable narrator, and DJ Beth is nonplussed with podcasting conventions. Also, Accuracy Third’s tribute to Powers Boothe.\n\nAccuracy Third needs your help! If you like what we’re doing, please subscribe to our podcast and rate us in iTunes, the Google Play store, or Stitcher.
