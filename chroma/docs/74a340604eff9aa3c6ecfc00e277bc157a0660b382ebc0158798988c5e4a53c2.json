  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is back with a second season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS02 E03 – Clowns Ruin Everything Episode One: I Need Another Dick\n\nD-Day, Rex, and Beth introduce the episode discussing non-monogamy, because we’ve got stories from one of the Orgy Dome’s organizers, Lazlo. He tells D-Day and Rex about the ins and outs and all the intimate parts of the Orgy Dome experience, including consent, ethical hedonism, and where the hell it is, anyway.\n\nS02 E04 – Clowns Ruin Everything Episode Two: These Are Not The Drugs You’re Looking For\n\nMoose works for Gate, and she’s chatting with D-Day and Rex about goddamn near everything insider-Burning Man. You’ll hear all about the bullshit that goes down behind the scenes of Black Rock City, and then you’ll hear why Gate can’t have nice things. All that, a whole lot more, plus we’ll tell you how to volunteer for The Man.\n\nS03 E05 – Is it your story?\n\nIt could be!
