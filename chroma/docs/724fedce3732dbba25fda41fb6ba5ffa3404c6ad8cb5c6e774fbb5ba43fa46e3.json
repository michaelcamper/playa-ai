We asked them our burning questions, and their responses were fascinating. Some discussed advances in VR technology. Others mused philosophically about the capacity of virtual worlds to expand endlessly, incorporating past, present and future Black Rock Cities.\n\nAll expressed excitement over having your help building their wildly creative experiences in preparation for Burn Week 2020 — August 30 to September 7 — when each Universe will be open and ready for intrepid explorers.\n\n“Wow,” you may be saying, “That sounds like fun! But just how can I bring my creativity and mad skills to help build these virtual Universes?”\n\nIf you’re Universe agnostic, and simply want to lend your flavor of tech wizardry to whichever Universe needs it, fill in this form and we’ll find you the best match. You can also browse the “Multiverse” category on spark.burningman.org to find opportunities to collaborate.\n\nWant to choose the Universe that makes your heart sing? Read on to learn how to add your art, your theme camp, or your tech skills to each and every Universe in the Multiverse.\n\nBRCvr\n\nBRCvr is Black Rock City in full VR, complete with current and past art installations, structures, theme camps, live talks, classes, and music performances. The veteran Burners behind this Universe have created a BRCvr Playa Toolkit that allows anyone with 3D software such as Blender or SketchUp to cut and paste pre-designed Burner objects to customize a virtual theme camp or art installation.\n\nBRCvr creators Athena Demos, Greg Edwards and Doug Jacobson explain how using the toolkit is like “playing with LEGO”.\n\nBuild-A-Burn\n\nBuild-A-Burn is like a sketch pad come to life — an interactive 2D digital space where participants can co-create a delightful art-filled playa that encourages explorers to connect with one another, join workshops, take in performances, and more. Truly anyone can contribute an art installation or theme camp —  simply upload your drawings, digital files or photographs and the Build-A-Burn team will render them in 2D for all to experience.\n\nBuild-A-Burn co-creator Dylan Jones details how easy it is to turn your photo or sketch into a 2D theme camp or art installation.\n\nBURN2\n\nBURN2 is an extension of the Burning Man culture and community into the world of Second Life. It is an officially sanctioned Burning Man Regional, the only virtual one out of more than 100 Regional groups worldwide. During Burn Week, anyone can dive into the Deep Hole BURN2 Sim to share a live performance. The crew behind BURN2 recommends that you explore the space first and connect with the community there to learn more about getting involved.\n\nThe Infinite Playa\n\nThe team behind The Infinite Playa has painstakingly recreated a photoreal landscape and immersive Black Rock City experience. Participants will be able to create their own avatar, roam the deep playa, ride on mutant vehicles, participate in live performances, and even dance until dawn. Artists, theme camps and inspired individuals all have the opportunity to bring their unique offerings — they’re seeking everything from digital rangers, to 3D modelers, art installations to live streamed performances.\n\nHelix Wolfson, half of the duo leading Infinite Playa, describes the types of humans he’s seeking to help bring his Universe to life.\n\nMultiverse\n\nMultiverse is a full-scale, virtual interactive Black Rock City, including the deep playa. The Multiverse crew has digitally recreated the entire landscape of Black Rock City 2019 — every street, every theme camp. All theme camps are built, and each has an infrastructure that allows it to broadcast content live or hold Zoom meetings simultaneously. All you need to do is register your camp with Multiverse and they will issue you a broadcasting channel that is accessible via a web browser.\n\nFaryar Ghazanfari from Multiverse speaks about adding your art to their Universe, and explains how easy it is to register and claim your 2019 camp in Multiverse.\n\nMysticVerse\n\nMysticVerse is a radical experiment of conscious collaboration, more about the journey and the process than the destination. If you are a builder, a maker, a co-creator who’s more committed to Build Week than Burn Week, the MysticVerse crew wants to collaborate with you in building a fully immersive, interactive 3D experience complete with theme camps, art installations, live events, and more. Anyone can join — from 2D and 3D modelers and project managers, to social engineers, visionaries and communicators.\n\nSimeone Scaramozzino and Cyberius Rex talk about their process for adding contributors to MysticVerse.\n\nSparkleVerse\n\nSparkleVerse is a 2D web-based Universe — kind of like a cross between Google Maps and a video game — where you can serendipitously mingle with other Burners who are in close proximity while co-experiencing magical spaces and performances. Everyone is invited to help co-create this decentralised experimental city in the Multiverse. The SparkleVerse crew has created tools for artists, theme camp organizers, performers and other magical humans to create immersive clickable spaces through which to deliver whatever imagination calls forth.\n\nThe SparkleVerse crew describes the people and skills they’re seeking — from software engineers to product managers, theme camp organizers to content creators.\n\nThe Bridge Experience\n\nA passion project created by theme camp organizers from The Love Burn, The Bridge Experience  is an interactive, fully immersive, 3D web-based Virtual Reality (XR) Camp/Burn accessible on any device. They welcome participation from all types of Burners — artists, volunteers, greeters, organizers, creatives, techies, theme camp organizers, and beyond.\n\nShare Your Live Event or Experience with the Universes via Kindling\n\nYou don’t need a digital presence to contribute your magic to the Multiverse. You can choose to share a live event or experience using Zoom, Twitch, Facebook Live, or any platform your little heart desires, as long as you provide a link for participants to reach it. This is a great option for anyone who wants to gift a workshop, class, gathering, DJ set, or other interactive experience.\n\nTo tell the Universes about your event, share it with Kindling by filling in the Kindle a Project form. Our shiny new live events portal functions as a centralized hub, where each and every Universe can choose the live events that fit with their experience. In other words, you only need to submit your experience once to make it accessible to all the Universes.\n\nTop photo: Charlie the Unicorn and “Rainbow Bridge” by Josh Zubkoff, 2018 as presented in BRCvr",
