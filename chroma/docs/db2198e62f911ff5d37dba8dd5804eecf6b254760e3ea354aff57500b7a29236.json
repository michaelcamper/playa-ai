  "content": "Last week I was honored to participate in “Sustainable Creative Communities, A Symposium at the Esalen Institute.”\n\nFrom the site: “This co-learning event will bring together 100 original thinkers, community innovators, and creative leaders from the Burning Man world and beyond for three days of deep discussion around art, money, generosity, and the future of creative communities.”\n\nI was beyond honored to be invited.\n\nI read through the bios and every person was amazing. In addition to Burning Man founders and key staff, there were people trailblazing with 3d Printing, Refugee work, massive fundraising, Maker Spaces, Communal living, epic art, and making the world a better place.\n\nWe were sent a reading list to study before we got there. You can check it out here.\n\nThe overall theme was “Placemaking, Money, Community, & Art.” (Larry Harvey’s essay on the subject is here. ) Fly Ranch was often discussed, but not the specific focus of this gathering. We also talked about supporting artists, nonprofit issues, legitimacy vs. disruption, Regional Network, acculturation, scarcity of tickets, and much more.\n\nWe had panel discussions, breakout groups, and a day of unconference topics. It was super stressful to pick what to attend. I wanted to go to everything. I had to split the list into “topics I have things to share about” and “topics I want to learn about.”\n\nBut it was the conversations in-between things that were the best. One hundred brilliant people who think about Burning Man as much as I do, with life experiences much different than mine. And since Burning Man took over the entire place, you could sit down next to anyone and know the conversation would be dust-filled and amazing.\n\nA lot of what was discussed was done so in confidence. It was a place to brainstorm and dream.\n\nWhat I can share was my experience. In no particular order, I learned:\n\nI feel supremely honored that I was included in this conversation. Thank you to the Esalen staff and everyone at Burning Man who put so much into making the event happen and the magic flow. And thank you, everyone, who contributes to make Black Rock City and the Burning Man community Home.",
