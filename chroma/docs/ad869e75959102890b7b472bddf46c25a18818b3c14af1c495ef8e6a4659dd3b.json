  "content": "While some people hit the playa dancing and go with the flow from there, others take a more intentional approach to their time at Burning Man, carefully thinking about what they’d like to get out of the experience and manifesting from there.\n\nI personally start each Burn with grandiose ambitions about doing yoga, taking classes, reading books, seeing all the art, catching all my favorite DJs, waking up at dawn, getting fit, eating healthy…and on and on. But in the swirl of playa time and my own bloated intentions, they never happen. So I wondered: “What are others’ intentions and how do they achieve them?”\n\nSo, not to make your Burn all, like, high-achieving or something, we sought stories about goal setting on the playa this year, and present 10 here that touch on relatable themes like self-discovery, life transitions, healing, relationships, and more.\n\nMaybe some of these mini-outlines will inspire you to think differently about your Burn in 2016 — or not! Blowing these off and hopping on the nearest dragon is a perfectly fine goal, too.\n\nThe beauty of this is that it’s up to you. All of it.\n\nTo rediscover who I am inside\n\nMy youngest just turned 18 and my identity as “mom” is being redefined. While at the Burn I will free myself from convention, from worrying what others will think, and let myself be who I truly am inside.\n\n— Karen. Middle of Nowhere, VA\n\nTo shake up how I burn\n\nMy number nine Burn needs to have radical newness, and that’s up to me to make it happen. I think breaking my “routine” will open me up to new things, and hence open me up to whatever the playa has to teach me this year.\n\nI think sticking to participating in familiar ways limits my experience. I want to re-submit to the desert, and the process, and see where it takes me. It’s not something I do well, in general, trying the new and unfamiliar. So consciously choosing to try the unfamiliar is a stretch, but good practice.\n\n— Ken Doll, San Rafael, CA\n\nTo take steps for my future, exit out of my current industry\n\nEveryone tells me I need to write a book about my life based on my effed-up experiences.\n\nI plan to explore my story at BM and how I can bring it back to the default world and make it my career over the next 10 years. How?\n\n— Jaymi Fallon, Agoura Hills, CA\n\nTo be naked more often\n\nAs a survivor of sexual assault, I have had a long journey back to feeling that my body belongs to me. Last year at Burning Man, I tip-toed into the experience of nakedness, which gave me a jumpstart to confront and process this part of my life at the Temple. I hope to embrace these feelings of vulnerability and self-acceptance again (and for the weather to be a little warmer) with some naked bike-rides!\n\n— Oakland, CA\n\nTo share my life quote and help at least one person discover their life quote\n\nMy life quote has helped me on my journey through life and has been a vital part of me becoming a Burner. A life quote, by my definition, is one that is original to you and not a quote of others that you favor. It is composed of words that have meaning to you. Once you have this life quote, you know it is right and yours when you feel it is truly how you have lived and are living your life.\n\n— Rod, Omaha, NB\n\nTo have a Burn that is focused on my internal journey and experience, rather than attempting to make sure everyone else has the Burn that they want (playa mom-ing)\n\nLast year was very hard, and I came back to the default world drained and resentful. I did not balance my experience and focused solely on those around me, with no thought for how *I* felt, and what *I* was experiencing. Even though this may sound selfish, I think it is integrally important to care for one’s self. You cannot truly give to others if you are personally in need.\n\n— Chairman Meow, Boston, MA\n\nTo THRIVE in a week of strange crowds, camping in a harsh desert wilderness environment for the very first time at age 61\n\nI was morbidly obese and sick with Lyme disease most of my adult life. I began to recover finally after 10 years of treatment almost five years ago now. I have lost 110 lbs. I now walk over five miles a day and hike up to 15 miles if the elevation is not too steep.\n\nI have never camped in the desert. I have never done ANY wilderness camping. And I’m a bit of an introvert, who only knows one other person attending Burning Man this year. When I was a young person, I was very adventuresome. I feel young, happy and free again now, so I want to be that adventuresome old lady that I was meant to be! I can do this!\n\n— Beverly Drottar MD, Beaverton, OR\n\nTo recharge my spirit, deepen friendship and connect with kindred souls\n\nMy default world demands put a strain on my emotional energy. As a social worker, I expend enormous amounts of energy creating harmony and finding solutions to society’s problems.\n\nBurning Man provides respite and affords me an outlet to get my freak on and express my wild side while sharing intimacy with like-minded people. I can step out of conventional society with conventional approaches and experience alternatives that provide a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of what society can evolve into.\n\n— Gail, Cedar Flat\n\nTo transition my relationship between myself and my son, as he approaches his 14th year\n\nMy son and I have always been close, and have been to Burning Man together three times before. (Well, four times if you count the year I was 8 months pregnant with him — and he does!) In previous years, I felt it was my imperative to protect him at the event and shield him from any harm. This year, that relationship is shifting more toward an experience of the event on an equal level, as kindred souls.\n\n— Jennifer Wilde, Oakland, CA\n\nTo shift the Earth into the next vibrational dimension\n\nI’m sick and tired of this dimension. Also, to bring about the new Earth of sacred beauty and harmony for us all to live in.\n\n—Harlan Emil Gruber, Taos, New Mexico\n\nTop photo by Mario Covic",
