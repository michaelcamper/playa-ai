  "content": "Do you remember the first time an amazing work of art at Burning Man opened your heart? For me, it was the Man itself, which I had the honor of sending to its fiery release at my first Burn in the desert in 1991. Now, imagine a newcomer coming to Black Rock City and experiencing Burning Man art for the first time, just as we did. How would their hearts open?\n\nRadical Self-expression is one of our core principles, and art has always been central to the Burning Man experience. A work of art can take you on a journey and give you insight into your own art spirit, for we are transformed from spectator to participant and we are given permission to become active contributors to the creative process.\n\nBut it also requires an incredible contribution from the community to make it possible — countless hours of work and the essential monetary support. When you tally it all up — the annual Honoraria grants, art support services such as heavy equipment, and ticket assistance for participating artists — the nonprofit’s annual cost for facilitating Black Rock City art is approaching $5 million. This is a relatively small part of the $55 million* estimated adjusted cost to produce the event in 2023, but it’s a priceless and irreplaceable part that brings so much joy to so many.\n\nWhile it may seem we just finished Black Rock City 2024, the Burning Man Project art team and artists around the world are still in high gear, focused on creating next year’s Burning Man art.\n\nThe Tomorrow Today art theme has been announced, the Honoraria grant process is underway, and proposals for the Temple have been submitted and are under review.\n\nBut ticket prices have not yet been set. In order to keep them reasonable, and to fully fund our art programs, we need elevated long-term financial support from the community to be able to plan with confidence for the future. Burning Man needs your help to raise $3 million that will go towards art and engagement in Black Rock City.\n\nAs stimulating as the art of Black Rock City is for so many people, its influence extends far beyond the city limits, reaching local communities around the world, every day of the year. Did you know — community members have helped place hundreds of art pieces from Black Rock City out in the world. The joy and connection on the playa reaches beyond it! I remember when we chose “Charon” by Peter Hudson for an Honoraria grant in 2011. Little did we know that work of art would spend years touring France, Belgium and the UK.\n\nArtwork that once had a life in Black Rock City can live again. By installing art in a community, the same creative energy that was born of the desert is exposed to new audiences. We always look for art that resonates in Black Rock City, and we are overjoyed when people around the world get the chance to experience this art too.\n\nWe are making progress toward the 2024 fundraising goal and we thank you for being so responsive and involved. The community goal for December to raise $3 million plays an important role in securing the future of Burning Man art — on the playa and in the world. And, that goal will help to keep Black Rock City accessible. If you have the means to contribute, I’m asking for your help. I have been part of building and running the art program since 1991 because of the people I’ve met and the art I’ve experienced at Burning Man events around the world.\n\nJoin me in supporting Burning Man Project with a tax-deductible donation today.\n\nBurn brightly,\n\nCrimson Rose\nBurning Man Co-founder\n\n*Note: The version that was emailed out earlier today incorrectly listed $48 million. The correct estimated adjusted cost to produce the event in 2023 is $55 million.",
