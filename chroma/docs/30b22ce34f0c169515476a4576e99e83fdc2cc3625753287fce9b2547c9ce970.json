  "content": "Greetings! We’re excited to announce three Internships in our San Francisco office.\n\nINTERNSHIP SUMMARY:\n\nThree unpaid internships will provide the right candidates with opportunities to engage with the pre-event preparations of Burning Man’s Communications Department, Regional Network and/or the Art Department during the busy pre-event production cycle (June-August) and on site in Black Rock City during the 2013 Burning Man event (August 25th – September 2nd).  Internships require a high level of organization, acute attention to detail and deadlines, top-notch written and verbal communication skills, and a keen ability to think quickly and function well in a high-pressure, creative environment that is often chaotic but always a lot of fun.\n\nInterns will be required to attend the Burning Man event, and must be prepared to be radically self-reliant for up to two weeks in that environment, one of few resources and intensely harsh conditions. Work leading up to the event will be conducted in a professional office environment in downtown San Francisco. The number of hours per week is flexible depending upon candidates’ needs, schedule, and experience. Candidates who are available to continue their internship post-event (through the end of September) are encouraged to apply.\n\nInternships will provide invaluable experience for someone wishing to learn about media relations, event production, and Burning Man arts and culture.  Interns will have opportunities to attend high level meetings, participate in planning processes, draft communications, and work alongside many accomplished professionals in the field of communications and arts management.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: In order to be eligible, interns MUST receive official school credit for their internship.  Prior to beginning an internship with Burning Man, candidates must provide written proof that credit will be received from the relevant educational institution.\n\nDUTIES & ESSENTIAL ROLE FUNCTIONS:\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT – MEDIA\n\nREGIONAL NETWORK AND OUTREACH\n\nART DEPARTMENT\n\nREQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:\n\nInterns must be able to attend Burning Man from Wednesday, August 19th through Tuesday, September 3rd, 2013.\n\n****These are unpaid positions. ****\n\nHOW TO APPLY:\n\nPlease send cover letter and resume to comm-intern@burningman.com.  Indicate if you have a preference for working with Media, the Regional Network, or the Art Department.  Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and we will continue to accept applications until positions are filled.\n\nQUESTIONS?\n\nFeel free to email comm-intern@burningman.com if you have questions or need additional information.",
