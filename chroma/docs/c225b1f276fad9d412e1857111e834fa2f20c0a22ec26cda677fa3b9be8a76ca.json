  "content": "We got out and about a little bit before the official start of Burning Man, and we got to talk to some of the artists and see some of the big pieces that are gracing the playa this year. We also were lucky enough to collaborate with Tod Seelie, the amazing Brooklyn photographer whoâ€™s been documenting underground culture for the past decade. Welcome aboard, Tod, and we thank you!",
