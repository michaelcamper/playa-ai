  "content": "Nope, never a dull moment here in Black Rock City. The weather report tells us to expect sustained high winds beginning midnight tonight (Friday), peaking 10 a.m. Saturday morning, and continuing through 6 p.m. Saturday evening.\n\nWinds are expected to gust up to 45 mph. Right, so what does that mean to you? Get ready and batten your stuff down! Like:\n\nIf you’re planning to come in tonight (Friday), definitely try to arrive before midnight.\n\nIf you’re planning to arrive on Saturday, consider postponing your arrival until later Saturday afternoon or evening. The way these things tend to go, your camp construction might be delayed due to the wind.\n\nKeep an eye on the Voices of Burning Man blog, Facebook, Twitter, BMIR and IHeartRadio, cuz that’s where we’ll keep you updated.",
