If you don’t know much about Larry, you can read some moving tributes here in the Journal, as well as on the public memorial site.\n\nLarry lived a life of purpose, play, creativity and service. One of his greatest talents was making opportunities for others to co-create in imaginative ways. The results sparked a network of participatory events, which gave rise to a year-round community and a global cultural movement. #thankslarry\n\nWho were you before you found Burning Man? Who are you now? What are you inspired to do? How do you want to see more Burning Man in the world?\n\nOn June 21 we invite and encourage you to join a global Burning Man celebration in honor of Larry by igniting your purpose and radiating your passion in ways consistent with the 10 Principles, whatever that means to you.\n\nJoin us for a day, an hour, or a moment on June 21.\n\nA Day: Consider the impact of our worldwide community contributing its sizable talents, gifts, and resources on the same day. Express yourself through clothing, host a storytelling gathering, build some art (and burn it, or not), gift something, volunteer, or organize a park clean-up. Engage with others in ways that reflect the best of Burning Man culture. What are your gifts?\n\nAn Hour: Join us in creating a global resonance of activity by gathering with your local community and sharing a meal, organizing a direct action, telling stories around a campfire, or anything else that speaks to you. The hour around sunset is a special time of reflection on the solstice, no matter which hemisphere you’re in. Where would you like to be?\n\nA Moment: The moment of sunset. As the sun sets around the planet, we’d like to honor all that being alive and active means to us and express gratitude for our lives, our gifts, and our community.\n\nHere in the SF Bay Area, the birthplace of Burning Man, we will join the wave of celebration at 8:35 pm PDT, as the sun dips below the horizon. We invite you to pause, (light a candle, howl at the moon, meditate, laugh, sing a song) and reflect on how Larry Harvey and Burning Man have affected your life.\n\nHowever you choose to express your gifts and gratitude, contribute to our collective story by sharing photos, video, and special moments at larry.burningman.org and on social media with the hashtag #thankslarry. Participate by going live on Facebook from your own celebration. Be sure to mention Burning Man and use #thankslarry, so we can see it and amplify it on our page. We’ll use our proverbial bullhorn to bring together everybody around the world participating in this moment. Tune in and follow the global wave of gratitude at larry.burningman.org and facebook.com/burningman.\n\nYou can also join our global Facebook event to easily keep up with the celebration around the world and share yours with everyone.\n\nOther opportunities to participate:\n\nThis Sunday, June 3 at the Desert Arts Preview, we will also take a moment to honor our original founder. Join us! And stay tuned for the announcement of an inspiring memorial event at the Castro Theater celebrating the life and legacy of Larry Harvey on July 14.\n\nIf you’re moved to support the art and philosophy work that Larry loved, we also invite you to support the Larry Harvey Art and Philosophy Fund.\n\nWhether it’s for a day, an hour, or a moment, let’s hold Larry and each other in the light, and celebrate not only the life and gifts of Larry Harvey but also our own.\n\nTop photo credit: Josh Lease",
