  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is back with a second season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS02 E11 – Fuck Off, Go Home\n\nThe episode we’ve been calling “DPW Dirty,” which means we consider “S02 E09 – Fuck You & Your Hug” the clean episode. There’s violence and naughty things from a whole bunch of anonymized argumentative DPW bastards … except for Friend-of-the-Show Xeno, who takes his credit as a matter of course. It’s fuck-ups, weirdos, bikers, and outlaws laying down together. DPW on Christmas, plug & play camps, choir practice, landmines, & adult stories from your adult children. Remember: all of this stuff happened a long, long time ago, to people who can no longer be implicated for their misdeeds. Also, a recognizable soundscape throughout.\n\nS02 E12 – Maker Series Episode One: I Loved You, & That’s Why I Called the Cops\n\nCarolina Sunshine is a fabulous engineer who makes a lot of things and solves a lot of problems with trash. There’s academicizing Burning Man, the playa problems of Dan Love, a lot of saying “trebuchet” in not a lot of time, and much mouth noises and singing. Carolina Sunshine gives us the Reno 411 on the City jail, before we discover the biggest betrayal of all. We invite you to party with Accuracy Third on playa, because we’ll be on playa, partying with or without you. Also, Rex thinks he could probably cook some meth, so send him your recipes!\n\nAccuracy Third needs your help! If you like what we’re doing, please subscribe to our podcast and rate us in iTunes, the Google Play store, or Stitcher.
