  "content": "After 30 years, someone turned the difficulty level up.\n\nBurners who have been here for decades and never had a problem with the amount of water they brought are suddenly wondering if their supplies going to make it through the week.  By Saturday afternoon I’m down to two gallon jugs and an assortment of electrolyte drinks.  Probably just more than I need to make it through exodus.  Probably.  If nothing goes wrong.\n\nPassionate Burners are thinking of leaving early, eying the hypothetical exodus lines, wondering if they’ll regret leaving this behind even a day early. “Why do we make it so hard on ourselves?” they ask.\n\nIn some ways first-time Burners are handling the environment with more aplomb:  people told them it would be hot, and lo and behold, it is.  They don’t know the air is thicker with suffering, and their long habits aren’t being broken.\n\nBut nothing could have prepared them for the psychological impact that the old-timers have to carefully walk them through.\n\n“I just had the best day of my life, and the worst day of my life,” a virgin Burner said to me, struggling to process.  “It’s been so amazing, but so impossible, and I think it’s changing me, and in good ways, but I don’t know what to do with that.  I don’t understand it.”\n\nAnd then he asks me.  “Why does this have to be so hard?”\n\nThe other day, I got an unexpected answer.\n\nThursday night was the first one that felt a little chilly, and people who might have complained about it in years past seemed to take comfort in the idea that they might want to put a jacket on after 11 o’clock.  I stopped by BMIR, where I was informed that a group of Irish videographers were there shooting film of people reading single pages of Finnegans Wake.\n\n“What?” I almost shouted. “The Finnegans Wake people are here? Where are they! Point them out!” They pointed.\n\nI walked over to one. He gave me a puzzled look. “I’m Caveat!” I said, because I couldn’t actually remember the name of the person I wanted to talk to.\n\nHis look grew more puzzled.\n\nI turned to the next. “Caveat!” I said excitedly, pointing at myself. He gave me a look that bouncers give people about to be asked if they can show themselves out.\n\nBut then the third man by the camera perked up. “Caveat?” he said. “YOU’RE Caveat!”\n\nAnd I was suddenly embraced in strong and grateful hug – which was not what I had expected to happen at all.\n\n“We couldn’t find you  last year!” he told me, arms squeezing. “It was always ‘oh, he was just here, you just missed him!’”\n\n“It works better for everybody that way,” I explained.\n\n“Well, man,” Gavan said (his name is Gavan), “it is wonderful to get to say thank you! This project is all happening because of you!”\n\nWe broke off the hug and I gave him a sincerely puzzled look. “That … isn’t true at all.”\n\n“Really. It is!”\n\n“No, honestly, I was nothing but the asshole getting in your way.”\n\nHe laughed, “yes you were!” but shook his head no. We were going to have to argue this out.\n\nIn 2016 Gavan sent Burning Man a media request asking if he and a small team could come to Burning Man to take video of people reading Finnegans Wake, one of the surreal masterpieces in western literature, which was written entirely in a kind of idiosyncratic, portmanteau and pun heavy, English doggerel. Gavan intended this to be his final piece for his MA in filmmaking, and thought it could be a kind of commentary on the nature of consciousness.\n\nOf course they could do it (since they had tickets), but it was one of the most off-beat requests we’d seen that year. And while I haven’t actually fielded press requests since 2013, Zac – who was managing the Burning Man press team at the time – sent it over to me, saying “I will give you one chance to take this guy under your wing.”\n\nI replied “Oh … oh … yes.”\n\nAnd then sent Gavan back a response written entirely in an imitation of the Finnegan’s wake style:\n\nTo which Gavan responded that same day:\n\nHis Finnegans Wake doggerel, incidentally, is much better than mine. But of course I couldn’t let this go.  So I responded:\n\nI then asked for the following information, which is a Finnegans Wake version of our media request form:\n\nHe filled out the form in the same style, and by God, neither of us ever let it go. We kept writing like this through the entire approval process, for almost two months, in Finnegans Wake style conversations, and gradually I hooked him up with other people in Media Mecca, and Journeylizm, and BMIR, who were as able to help him as they were baffled and amused by the strange conversation dumped in their lap.\n\nThat was 2016. And apparently everything worked so well for them (you can see their project here) that they’ve decided to expand the project: not just recording people reading some of Finnegans Wake at Burning Man, but videoing Burners reading the whole book, one page at a time. They expect it to take 17 years, one year per chapter – exactly the amount of time it took Joyce to write it in the first place.\n\n“Honestly, I’ve never seen the media team hustle more to support a project,” Zac would later say.  “Everybody was just so motivated to help these guys get what they needed.”\n\n“And it’s all happening because of you!” Gavan said. “You made this possible!”\n\n“Oh no, no no,” I said, stunned. “I was just the guy making your life hell by insisting we talk like the book for the whole time.  I made it so much harder for you than it needed to be!”\n\n“Oh, it was terrible!” he agreed, laughing. “I was sitting there all the time thinking, ‘dammit, I have to figure out my food and WHAT THE HELL IS HE TELLING ME NOW?’ I was pulling my hair out. But it was also wonderful and funny and inspiring to do, and then everything with the project just fell into place. Fell into place perfectly, couldn’t have happened better, couldn’t have happened any other way, and now we’re fucking doing it. It’s amazing, and I can’t believe it’s taken us this long to thank you.”\n\n“Well, okay, but really it didn’t have to be …” and then I stopped, and decided to just accept the win.\n\nI mean, didn’t I do this on purpose?  Choose weird and fun and maybe even inspiring over efficient and sensible?\n\nIsn’t this how I want the world be? The way I want things to work?\n\nCover Photo a screen shot of Gavan Kennedy’s 2016 Finnegan’s Wake project",
