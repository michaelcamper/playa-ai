  "content": "Who knows where traditions come from at Burning Man? But here’s another one: Sweetthang announced at the morning meeting that yes, in fact, today is Topless Tuesday. Whereupon a fair number of women — and men — took off their shirts, to general hoots and hollers. And then everyone went about their normal business.\n\nMany people think that nobody wears any clothes at Burning Man anyway, but of course this is not true. The costumes here are completely fabulous.\n\nAnd this is probably not the time or place to delve into feminist theory and discuss the liberating experience that comes from the simple act of taking off your shirt. But I’ll say this: it doesn’t seem odd here. (Still, we maintain eye contact while talking to participants of TT. It’s just the way we are.)\n\nSo feel free to discuss the question of nudity on the playa, and whether you’ll be going au naturale or not. There are no wrong answers. And here’s another pic to get the ball rolling. From behind, because there’s no reason to get all horndog-y about it.",
