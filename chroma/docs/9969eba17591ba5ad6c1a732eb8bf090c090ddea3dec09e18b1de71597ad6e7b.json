  "content": "Greetings friends!\n\nJust a small entry today to acknowlege and say farewell to one of our Regional Contacts who is about to embark on a year-long adventure around the world. I had just arrived in London and was lucky enough to catch a few hours with Matt aka Snowstorm before he left to embark on his super adventure. And we were not alone! In true Regional tradition, Danielle from Atlanta was visiting London at the time and joined us for a little bit of Regional love.\n\nSnowstorm has been integral to the European burner community for many years, serving as a RC in London as well as stepping up as the European RC. It is because of his hard work and dedication that we at BMHQ have an understanding of all the amazing things and people working to make them happen in this neck of the woods. It was a wonderful moment for a coffee and a chat to send Matt along on his adventure with a big hug and promises of finding each other on playa next year.\n\nFarewell dear Snowstorm, may your travels be exciting and safe.\n\nDear readers in Regional Land if you happen to cross paths with our Matt please give him a hug and the warmest of receptions as he has done for so many before us.",
