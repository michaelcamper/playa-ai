  "content": "Now that there’s a scarcity-based market for Burning Man tickets, the scammers are coming out of the woodwork. Be aware, be wary, get educated, and don’t get screwed. We’re hearing about these from a lot of people who are about to get nailed, so we thought we’d let you know about them.\n\nDo NOT Wire Money\n\nA lot of the known scams right now involve payments requested to “Ticketmaster Fan-protect exchange program”, which requires wiring money through Western Union to the UK. Moneygram/Western Union actually allows the seller to pick up the money without having sent anything first, no matter what they say in their fine print. REFUSE TO PAY FOR TICKETS THROUGH WESTERN UNION OR MONEYGRAM … PERIOD.\n\nAlso, some are using a payment method called “Green Dot” and they’re routed through someone who isn’t the original owner of the ticket. If you’re buying a ticket from somebody who isn’t the original owner of the ticket, be especially careful.\n\nImpersonating Real Tickets\n\nThere are also people getting ticket photos off of eBay, then gleaning ticket numbers through other means, and selling tickets they don’t have in their possession.\n\nAlways check the ticket number with us BEFORE you buy, by emailing us at partiserv@burningman.com. [UPDATE: Please note that we no longer verify ticket numbers because we cannot actually validate tickets in the hands of a third party.] None of these scammers will accept Paypal as a payment … never buy a ticket online unless you can do it through Paypal, which is the only way you can have possible recourse if you get scammed.\n\nCounterfeits in LA, San Diego and Santa Barbara\n\nThere’s a guy selling counterfeit tickets in the LA area … the name on the tickets he’s selling is Cory O’Brien. THIS IS NOT THE NAME OF THE GUY DOING THE COUNTERFEITING … JUST THE NAME ON THE TICKETS. At least one of the people selling this ticket is going by the name “Ruben”. The ticket number is 03703 TWVTO53W … if you get offered these tickets, don’t buy them, call the cops. Learn how to spot a counterfeit ticket, and ideally bring a REAL ticket with you to compare them before you buy. If you encounter somebody selling counterfeit tickets, get all the information you can and CALL THE POLICE.\n\nCounterfeits in San Francisco and Reno\n\nThere’s a guy in San Francisco selling counterfeit tickets, and now those same tickets are being sold in Reno as well. Learn how to spot a counterfeit ticket, and ideally bring a REAL ticket with you to compare them before you buy.  The ticket numbers are JL853RJX 13682 and JL853RJX 13681. If you encounter somebody selling counterfeit tickets, get all the information you can and CALL THE POLICE.\n\nMore info about how to buy/sell more safely can be found on our ticket page.",
