  "content": "Did you know Burning Man started as a beach burn on the solstice? Unlike the end-of-summer Black Rock City event we now know and love, the original Man was burned on Baker Beach on Saturday, June 21, 1986.\n\nAs we continue to consider how the 10 Principles can be applied to everyday life, and to remember Larry Harvey and what he initiated, we invite you, members of the global Burning Man community, to join us for a weekend of action, service, and celebration June 21, 22 and 23.\n\nYou may remember last year’s June 21 Global Celebration and Day of Gratitude, honoring our original instigator. It was a beautiful moment, with touching tributes coming in from all over the world (for details check out Thanks for Giving Thanks: Celebrating Larry Harvey’s Life and Legacy on the Solstice).\n\nThis year we’d like to reignite the flames — across the globe and right here in the Bay Area. This June solstice weekend we invite you to take creative initiative to activate and celebrate the ethos of Burning Man in your year-round community.\n\nHow can you leave a positive trace?\n\nWe hope you will be inspired to collaborate, make, serve, celebrate, and unite. What we do outside of Black Rock City is as, if not more, important than the event in the desert. To sustain this culture, we need creative action and civic participation.\n\nHere in the San Francisco Bay Area, Burners Without Borders, Permaculture Action Network, and Burning Man Project’s Community Events Team are organizing a permaculture action day to leave a positive trace.\n\nPermaculture Action Day in Oakland — June 22 – 10am-7pm PST\n\nIf you’re in the Bay Area, ring in the first day of summer and celebrate the transformative principles of Burning Man with a permaculture action day at Hoover Elementary School in West Oakland, which has a long history of supporting creativity, sustainability, and community.\n\nWe will complete much-needed, hands-on projects including gardening, outdoor furniture building and mural creation while working beside one another. Think of this as a daytime festival, where work is the headliner! This fun, free, family-friendly event will include workshops, music, stage performances, art, and food.\n\nBurners Without Borders unlocks the creativity of local communities to solve problems that bring about meaningful change through human-centered design and participatory citizenship. Since 2014, the Permaculture Action Network has organized 92 Permaculture Action Days, mobilizing over 13,000 people to take hands-on action in their own communities to shape a just and regenerative world. Check out the video below to see what’s in store for those who can join us in Oakland.\n\nInvite your friends and check out the Facebook event for more info. RSVP form coming soon. To get involved as a performer, musician, volunteer, or workshop lead please email actionday@burningman.org!\n\nGet Involved Around the World\n\nThe permaculture action day is just one way to engage this June solstice weekend.\n\nWhether you’re a Regional Contact, a theme camp or mutant vehicle lead, a member of a local BWB chapter, a community activist, or a motivated citizen who has never been to Burning Man, we encourage you to connect with your local communities and work on something together or on your own. Find a project in your area, commit to a few hours of community work with others, or plan something entirely new with a circle of friends. Let’s join together for a weekend of Civic Responsibility, Participation, and Communal Effort. Bring Burning Man to the world around you!\n\nNot sure what to do? Contact your local school and see if they need help. Get a group of friends together and clean up your local park while you picnic. Or, if you’ve never reached out before check out the Regional Network and locate a Burning Man community near you. Whatever you do, feel free to make it fun and self-expressive!\n\nShare Your Stories\n\nFollow the community’s discussions and plans for this Global Weekend of Action here. Contribute your ideas, and feel free to post your photos, videos, audio clips, and writings. If you post on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, use the hashtags #thankslarry and #burningsolstice so we can find and share your content.\n\nIf an idea occurs to you after the weekend is over, remember that sometimes the best ideas take a while to manifest (we’ve certainly learned that on the playa!). So, make it happen next year, or make it happen anytime, anywhere. You don’t have to be in Black Rock City to create a Burning Man experience. #burnallyear. Thanks Larry! …and thank YOU!\n\nHere’s a video from an Action Day in Los Angeles!\n\nTop photo by Sharon Avraham, design by Tanner Boeger",
