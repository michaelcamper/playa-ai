  "content": "For the last few years, Burning Man staffers have attended the SXSWi conference in Austin, TX to learn, connect and develop our minds around community organizing and technology, discovering what’s going on with cutting edge social and cultural tech — ever-more important as our population grows and spreads further around the world. (Our relationship with the technology world goes back years — November 1996’s WIRED magazine declared Burning Man “The New American Holiday”, after all.)\n\nAs Burning Man is effectively a social network in and of itself, we realized that we have a lot to contribute to the SXSWi conversation as well. So this year, we decided to send a somewhat larger contingent — including staff members from Communications and Technology teams as well as two Burning Man Board members– to participate in this tech-cultural institution, sharing information and ideas.\n\nWe’re excited to connect with the Austin Burner community while we’re in town, too. To that end, we’ve hooked up with our friends at Honk to help celebrate the climax of the HONK! TX festival, an energetic street-music festival featuring some of the most amazing marching bands in the country.  Following their final parade, we’ll be heading over to Pan-American Park at 2100 E. 3rd Street on Sunday, March 13 from 5-8pm to join them for some fun. There’ll be Texas BBQ (by Lick and Suck), and all the interactive eye candy you can stomach – including you, SXSW Burners (after all, there are only participants in this world).\n\nIf you’d like to join us, we will be marching with the HONK parade, and then celebrating with them in the park … and remember, YOU are the entertainment. Participate! And Leave No Trace! Show SxSWi what interactive is all about!  What is that? A costume? A bizarre piece of performance? You bring it!\n\nWe hope to see you there!",
