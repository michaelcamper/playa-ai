  "content": "Flags are everywhere.\n\nPosts, beams, cables, spikes … eventually, all these flags will have something put in the ground where there are only flags now.\n\nSurveyors have been out walking, consulting maps, stepping off distances, trying to make sure that drawings and plans become actual facts on the ground.\n\nYesterday, Monique and Danny were working their way around the rim of Center Camp, repeating the same process over and over and over again: Go to the pink and green flag, put a stake on the digging machine, slowly rotate it into the ground,  adjust the sheath, put it in a little further, adjust the sheath again, then sink it so that only a  loop of steel was peeking out of the dust.\n\nLater, cables will be attached to keep the shade sturdy.\n\nDanny is very much like a lot of people out here: He’s got another life in the default word, but more and more the Burner life and the default world are intersecting.\n\nEarlier this year, he went to Peru in the wake of the earthquake there to help put devastated villages back together again. He’s got a variety of skills — plumbing, electricity, carpentry — so he brings a lot to the party. He planned on spending a week helping out, then he’d spend a couple of weeks traveling around. “Two months later, I was still there,” he said.\n\nThe villagers were accustomed to having water for only an hour a day, and that was before the earthquake.  “But they were happy,” Danny said. “They’d just say, hey, it’s Peru.”  So he and the other Burners Without Borders were building concrete tanks that would gather water, so the villagers would have water when they needed it, not just when it was running.\n\nSo how does a guy find it possible to go helping people out around the world? “I sold a software company at the right time,” Danny said.",
