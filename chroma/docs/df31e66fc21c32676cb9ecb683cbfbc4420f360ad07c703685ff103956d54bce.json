  "content": "In early 2019, the Prince George’s African American Museum and Cultural Center in Maryland held a three-month show featuring my “Soul Illuminance” collection, one of two exhibitions displayed at the Everywhere Pavilion in Black Rock City 2018.\n\nWhen the museum asked me to hold the show, they had been looking for somebody who experienced a different view of living as a person of color: a futurist view, a view of hope and something that spoke to what I’ve come to find out is my Burn — a person living and expressing their truth.\n\nWith my art, you can ask what it’s made of — I work in oils, acrylics, watercolors, temperas, glass, metal, marble, body painting and casting — but it’s really about re-making our vision of ourselves as people of color who embrace color and live beyond the boundaries of color.\n\nI think these boundaries are ones we have mentally put on ourselves because we have been restrained by so many forces, both from within and without. When TV doesn’t show you honorable depictions of yourselves and most times people are so broken that they forget that they can do almost anything, we teach ourselves to stop thinking, stop growing, stop asking, stop creating.\n\nBut being of color and representing color is an honor, and all of this is learned behavior. When someone like me comes through the door who is vibrant and self-fulfilling, it can have a positive disruptive effect on the community.\n\nBurn Life\n\nMost of the time when I’m at Burns, people think my hairstyle and my clothing is just for the Burn. But living like this is who I’ve always been. For example, some people around DC and the world will approach me to compliment my hair and the feathers in it. Depending on how many times I’ve already had that conversation that day, I may tell them politely but firmly that it is my headdress, that I adorn it to pay homage to and respect my ancestors.\n\nFor some people, they see feathers in one’s hair as just a look, but for me it is much more: it’s owning and representing the legacy that I am a part of, and that legacy is Cherokee, Powhatan, Shinnecock and Creole. I also infuse this intentionality and purpose into the clothes I make.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nI grew up surrounded by creative family and friends, and as a professional artist of over 20 years, my life has always been centered around expressing my truth and light, which my community has embraced.\n\nBurning has just made living a little bit more interesting. For the last five years I’ve travelled the world; been invited to different conferences and Regionals to help with art direction, costume, and makeup; and been provided the one community that allowed me to create and play in all of my mediums.\n\nSomething was bound to change. The art I started making. But let’s start at the beginning.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nAfter my first Burn, I created a collection explaining to my long-term Capitol Hill clients what Burning Man was for me. My first year was a peek into a vast new world, where I was able to see some of the greatest artists and pieces that were so momentous they demanded respect. Artwork that was sacred geometry and sacred to bear witness to in such an environment.\n\nOne evening while creating this collection, “Soul Illuminance” was born, wherein I combined years of creating orgonite, making body molds and sculptures that spoke of the light that resonated out of the individuals I met.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nAfter that first year, I realized it was important for me to find my soul, my footing, my place in this community. In the default world, my appearance as a woman of color seems to be defined for me. At Burns, I have the opportunity to define it as I see fit and appropriate.\n\nOne of the great camps that allowed me room to grow and cultivate so much of my spirit to gift was Foam Camp. While there for three years, I was able to contribute to costume design, art direction and costume makeup, and I had the opportunity to do shows with some of the best psychedelic artists in the world. Humbling. Life changing.\n\nAnd life just kept changing.\n\nIn the Middle\n\nAs an artist who had been in DC for two decades selling artwork, my experience at Burning Man made me look at positioning my art in a global community. It made me branch out and prepare for those worldwide opportunities. It also opened my work up to new people around the world and new audiences right here in DC who were able to enjoy the esoteric qualities in my creations.\n\nI began to stop holding back. It allowed me an opportunity to look at decades of experience and really allow myself to play again within my own field. It gave me a sense of my inner five-year-old, which I nurtured alongside the 40-year-old creative with decades of experience. As I grew, it was wonderful to see the people around me grow as well. The communities and camps continue to grow in my heart, as well as the new camps I have begun to create with.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nOnce you’ve experienced why creatives love Burning Man, it just seems natural to be able to branch out like the Tree of Ténéré with all the possibilities and all the glow. And with everything that’s happened over the last few years in Black Rock City, 2018 turned out to be epic.\n\nThe Everywhere Pavilion recognized and asked me to exhibit my pieces, and it was the welcome home that my heart had wanted since I first came to Black Rock City. When I arrived at my art show and saw many of my friends — somehow without watches and understanding of time there to support me — I knew I had found that place in my community.\n\nAnd to have mayors, who’d come from across the country to see what a community-centered city looked like, speak with and understand me — these are only opportunities that can be made in the desert.\n\nPrince George & Telling Our Own Stories\n\nThen you know you’re doing it right, when your worlds collide. In November 2018, Prince George’s African American Museum & Cultural Center asked to exhibit my pieces and came to see my work in my studio. Like the people from the Everywhere Pavilion, they said the same thing: “We want everything.”\n\nSo for three months they got everything: the Mermaid that graced Foam Camp one year, had her second year at Everywhere, and was then given pride of place in an acrylic case in a museum in Maryland. There was also the piece created out of negatives from the Temple David Best built for the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which a generous vendor from Eastern market gifted to me instead of throwing them away. Those pieces went from DC to playa and then the museum.\n\nBringing my art to the African-American community in Prince George’s County was bringing joy back home, from the exhibition opening to a fashion show. My Burning Man experiences mean that now I only want to make time for things that bring love and joy.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nIn fact, one of the people who attended our panel, “The Art of Business, and the Business of Art”, came to the museum on a whim. She happened to bring a book of her art that no one else had ever seen. After meeting the artist, I asked the Museum Director to look at her work. She would go on to have her own show in the gallery less than a month after my own had ended.\n\nIt was emotional to shine the light I was in and say that y’all need to take a look, to catch someone who could’ve slipped unnoticed through the cracks. It’s amazing when you can improve another artist’s quality of life, work and path.\n\nBecause there is no guide book for this, especially for people of color. So often the stories have not been told by us, but about us. In sharing my own, very unique art, I can only hope to share a story in color that is not defined by color, just by me.\n\nTop photo courtesy of Quest Skinner",
