Behind all of the words and links below are real Burners doing spectacular things out in the world. And all of them are available for you to plug into, participate in, and stir up some Burner magic — even right NOW.\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure — What Do YOU Want to Do?\n\nCommune with Burner Art\n\nCo-create Virtual Burning Man\n\nVirtual Burning Man will be alive and kicking for two entire weeks this year — August 21 to September 5, 2021. The earlier you offer your skills, idea, or project, the more you will get out of this global virtual adventure. Get involved with Virtual Burning Man.\n\nGet Your Groove On Year-Round at Virtual Burning Man Events\n\nYou don’t have to wait until August to start co-creating and participating in virtual Burning Man adventures that span the globe. Here are some ways to Burn virtually, year round.\n\nParticipate in Your Regional Community\n\nWhile most Regional Events went virtual or were cancelled in 2020, we expect a few small in-person events to resume in 2021. Many Burners find their true “home” close to home, getting involved with their Regional group. Participating in community service projects, collaborative art, Pre-compressions, Decompressions, and other Regional Events is only the beginning of what’s possible. Check the Regionals map to find your nearest Regional community.\n\nBring About Positive Change in Your Community as a Burner Without Borders!\n\nBehind that glowy facade, there’s meaningful work being done in the Burner-verse. Through Burners Without Borders, people are coming together worldwide to support their communities.\n\nTell Us About Your Projects, Ideas, and Initiatives\n\nLog into your Burner Profile to tell us about the impact-driven projects and initiatives you’re creating out in the world. What we learn will help us map the ways Burning Man culture is being applied to address conventional challenges.\n\nCollaborate and Share Ideas in Burning Man Hive Labs\n\nDive into Burning Man Hive Labs to collaborate on shared goals for evolving Black Rock City and Burning Man culture around sustainability; Radical Inclusion, diversity and equity (R.I.D.E.); health and safety; and participation. Sign up here to join and add your voice.\n\nContribute to Making Burning Man More Radically Inclusive, Diverse and Equitable\n\nIn collaboration with you, we are doubling down on the work of changing the landscape of Burning Man Project, Black Rock City, and Burner communities and gatherings with regard to Radical Inclusion, diversity, and equity.\n\nContribute to a Regenerative Black Rock City\n\nBurning Man Project’s 2030 Environmental Sustainability Roadmap sets a 10-year timeline and targets for making Black Rock City regenerative. And it’s open source — you can contribute to its evolution!\n\nTell the World About Your Live Virtual Event\n\nIf you’re creating a live virtual community event — maybe it’s a workshop, dance party, performance, puppet show… or anything, really — submit it to Kindling, Burning Man Project’s virtual events portal.\n\nBuild a Theme Camp\n\nMany Theme Camps do interesting stuff year round. Maybe it’s your turn to start one?\n\nExpand Your Mind\n\nStay up to Date",
