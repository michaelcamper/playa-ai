  "content": "We can now add to the abundant crop of books about Burning Man a children’s book: Burning Man – the World’s Biggest Playground by writer, photographer and father Peter Armenia. For several years, Peter made personal books for his young daughter, who was not with him on the playa until 2015; that process inspired him to create this book. At 8.5 inches square with 56 pages of color photos, Peter’s book is entertaining to adults as well as children. The simple text and well-chosen photos cover all the basic features of Black Rock City including art, Mutant Vehicles, the Man, the burn, the dust, Theme Camps, volunteers, costumes and play.\n\nHave you wished that your family members would bring their children to the event? Do you want your own kids to see what you do out there? Have friends who want to bring their kids, but are hesitant? This is a good book for them, presenting a clear picture of what happens in the desert and conveying the wonder a child likely feels, surrounded by gigantic art objects and friendly costumed participants.\n\nThe author says, “Why should the grown-ups have all the fun? Children have been going to Burning Man since its inception on Baker Beach in San Francisco in 1986. The kids already get it. It’s the rest of us who have to remember to have fun as we walk through life. And there’s no better place to learn that than Burning Man – The World’s Biggest Playground!”\n\nFor more information, visit theworldsbiggestplayground.com.",
