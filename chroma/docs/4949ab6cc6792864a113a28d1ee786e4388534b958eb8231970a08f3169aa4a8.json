  "content": "[This post is part of the Metropol Blog Series.]\n\nHow do you get 50,000 people gathering in a remote desert to Leave No Trace of their having been there… without a garbage can in sight?  How do you encourage a bike, pedestrian and public transportation culture in a country addicted to the automobile?  How do you change the collective consciousness — and behavior — of a city’s population?\n\nJaime Lerner re-invented urban space in his native Curitiba, Brazil. He participated in the 2007 TED Conference in Monterey, CA, where he gave an inspired presentation about revolutionizing bus transit, awakening green consciousness in a populace accustomed to litter and blight, and changing the way city planners and bureaucrats worldwide conceive what’s possible within the metropolitan landscape. And he throws in a little song for good measure.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about affecting social change through urban planning?",
