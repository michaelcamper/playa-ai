  "content": "I recently re-posted a video encouraging people to see themselves as artists. One criticism that came out was that I did not value the importance of nuts & bolts construction contributions. And I agree. As important as costumes & personal expression is, it is important to remember all the talent that goes into BUILDING this city, too.\nI made this quick video to let people know how important the builders are AND to make sure everyone knows that we are all responsible for helping with the heavy lifting, too!\n\nThe “You are an Artist” Video.",
