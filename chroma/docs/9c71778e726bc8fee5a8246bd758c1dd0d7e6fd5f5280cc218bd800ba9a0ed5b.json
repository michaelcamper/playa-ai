  "content": "For as long as I’ve been involved, people have been saying that “the Regionals are the future of Burning Man.” But at first they said it in a distant, hopeful tone, the way they’d say that “someday we’ll end world hunger.”\n\nA decade later, something changed. They were still saying “the Regionals are the future,” but this time they were saying it as words of encouragement. A pat on the head. It meant: “Look at you go! You’re really getting there. This could happen someday!”\n\nNow though, now… I haven’t heard anyone say it in a while. I assume they still do. But I think it’s actually happened. Without fanfare, without ceremony or a big moment of transition, it looks to me like the moment has not only arrived but already occurred. The Regionals have become the future of Burning Man.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, first, a few words of caution are in order.\n\nI’m really big on words of caution. I like offering them a lot. Hopefully it’s fun for you, too.\n\nWait 45 minutes after you eat to go swimming.\n\nDon’t give your passport to a monkey. Even if he’s wearing a hat.\n\nWhat I’m saying about the Regionals isn’t based on personal observation, I’m afraid. It’s been years — many years — since I’ve been to a Regional. Honestly, I don’t get out of the house much, not since that monkey stole my passport. I’ll be damned if he’s going to find my buried gold.\n\nThere are too many regional events to keep track of anyway (especially when we include the unofficial ones that are still culturally consistent), and no way to verify that all of them are the future. We’re talking about approximations here, trend lines.\n\nCertainly the Regionals are, on average, bigger than they were before. And more independent. But it’s more than that: the kind of stories I’m hearing from people who have participated in Regional Events have changed — a lot — over the last few years.\n\nI’ve always heard good things about the Regionals, and had great times at the ones I’ve attended. But the kind of stories I used to hear from Regionals — not all, but most, of the time — were good camping stories. Even excellent camping stories. Often with a good through line of art and whimsy. You could see why people enjoyed it and why they showed up and it certainly represented aspects of Burning Man culture.\n\nBut they didn’t tend to hit the peaks of experience, the really extraordinary “how the fuck was that even possible, and my God, I’m glad to live in a world where things like that can happen” quality that the best Burning Man stories out of Black Rock City tend to have. That quality often seemed to be conspicuously absent.\n\nBut lately? The last couple of years? The stories I’ve been hearing, from people I know and trust, out of many different Regionals have blown me away. Given me shivers. Made me glad to live in a world where this is happening… and happening everywhere.\n\nSomething has changed.\n\nMaybe these kinds of experiences were happening there for years, and I just didn’t hear about it — that’s entirely possible. Maybe it represents a shift in cultural practices, or population, or that it just takes some time for newer events to start to hit a magic tipping point. I don’t know, and I don’t claim to know: your mileage may have varied. In fact, the whole point is that your mileage may vary. Please consult an epistemologically minded mechanic if your “check reality” light comes on.\n\nBut whether it’s culture or age or communication, something has changed. The Regionals, it seems to me, have gone from “they will be the future someday” to “they are the future that is happening right now.”\n\nAnd it’s glorious.\n\nIt is also — and I think this is the important point — a different kind of future than we were being led towards when Black Rock City was the Vatican of the Burning Man universe.\n\n(Which, to be clear, I’m saying it’s not anymore, although it’s far from irrelevant. There are plenty of important places in the world that are “not the Vatican.” I bet we can name three. HINT: one of them has waffles.)\n\nA lot of trends impacting Black Rock City have been identified over the years, which do not (so far) apply to the Regionals:\n\nThe increasing size of BRC, obviously, which in some ways makes it a different animal. Not only are the Regionals smaller, they have often capped their populations more aggressively.\n\nThe increasing cost of going to BRC, from buying a ticket to travel; the Regionals are, by definition, more local (although the number of people who attend events like Love Burn and AfrikaBurn from out of state and out of country is notable).\n\nThe Regionals have a shot at not just more diversity but different kinds of diversity, as they can connect directly with the local communities around them — which is, to my mind, the most authentic and organic way of inviting others into Burner culture. Be helpful to your neighbors.\n\nThese aspects of Regionals have already been seen and commented upon, but there’s another that I think is just as vital but hasn’t received nearly as much attention:\n\nOver time, “big art” has been emphasized in Black Rock City — the major sculptures, the massive structures, the giant art cars — while the “human-sized art experiences,” the “small art,” the weird and magical moments of human interaction, have been increasingly neglected. They’re present, absolutely, but they get less and less time and attention. It’s been evident for a long time, but just three years ago I wrote:\n\nAs BRC becomes more and more associated with big and in some ways impersonal art, the stories I’m hearing from the Regionals are more and more associated with these magical human experiences. They have big art and impressive structures, sure, but they also seem to be picking up what many of us feared were the increasingly lost arts of small human weirdness and putting them front and center — which serves to re-center them in Burning Man culture as a whole.\n\nThis is both a move into the future and an act of faith with the past. In a lengthy examination of Burning Man’s philosophy, I once noted that “the premise of festivals like Woodstock and Coachella is that ‘you had to be there to experience it!’. The premise of Burning Man is: ‘I can do this myself!'”\n\nThe Regionals are making that more true than ever. They are the new centers of human centered DIY experiences, and they are doing it locally and closer to year round. Where they take it, I don’t know. Nobody does. We are, more than ever, the decentralized movement that we always aspired to be.\n\nAnd this is the point: the more “the Regionals become the future of Burning Man,” the less we are going to be able to predict the cultural change that results.\n\nIt has been truly inspiring to me to hear these stories, and I can’t wait to see what happens next.\n\nCover image of AfrikaBurn, 2024 (Photo by Kim van Zyl)",
