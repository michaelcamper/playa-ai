  "content": "So, it would seem like the men of the DPW here in Black Rock City look forward more than a little bit to dressing up like the inner babes that they are for Ladies Night.\n\nSeriously, we are talking major strumpet activity.\n\nIt was a night of crossovers. All of the men HAD to be dressed as women in order to get into the party, but a lot of the women did the double cross and dressed as men.\n\nIt was the kind of night where you really had to be careful who you were grabbing, and where.\n\nElo in fishnets, Tennessee in a tight tank and oh my god Joe the Builder as the tranny you had no idea he could possibly be.\n\nEasy Going was a beautiful bride, Logan was more than a little fetching, and there just was so much hot male/female action, you’d think this might not be the only day of the year these dudes break out the hot pants.\n\nAn all-star judging panel of Megs, Serra, Austin and Big Spoon  had a gargantuan task on their hands, going over all the entrants and awarding prizes in various categories. In the end, it was Joe the Builder who copped the Best Female award, and it was pretty much by acclimation. Apparently he knows how to build a feminine physique along with an electrical system and a Center Camp.\n\nAnd a bunch more photos after the jump.",
