  "content": "We got an email on Thursday evening while at Burning Man that our condo in Oakland had flooded, so I decided to come home a little early.  The plumbers were able to fix it from the outside but the management company said that there was water in the outside hallway, and we found that fairly concerning.  So I was up early on Friday morning, down the hill, a little clean-up and all is okay.  But you know I am missing y’all, you know who you are.\n\nI camp with The Mansonian Institute, and we always have an amazing mix of campers.   This year we have a lot of crew from The Generator, because my camp leader, Joe Olivier, is on the Board of Directors. Many of them were involved in building Pier 2 and La Llorona in 2012.  I immediately liked Fish, young enough to be my grandson and kind, smart and attentive.  So when I discovered he was also a photographer I of course wanted to see his photos, and to share them with you.  So from here at home, on my little porch, is a new photographer that I am sure you will be seeing again, Aleks Stirajs. The first Truth is Beauty shot is during the electrical storm during set up and it is my favorite.",
