  "content": "Part camping trip, part survival exercise, Burning Man requires a lot of utilitarian gear. Water cubes, tents, duct tape, rebar… these are the things of our desert lives. Practical items are necessities but what of the little things that make life grand? We’re out there to have fun not just survive. I’m a tent camper so things are pretty streamlined for me. But that doesn’t mean I don’t sleep in fancy PJs.\n\nA quick quiz of friends turned up these personal luxury must-haves:\n\ncopper mug for cocktails\ncalligraphy set\nsolar charger for iPod\nchef’s knife\nfancy boots\nthrow pillows\none bottle of nice Pinot Noir\nred lipstick, kept in the cooler to avoid melting\nseparate tent just for costumes\nhigh thread-count sheets and feather duvet\nspray bottle with a fan\nfull-length mirror*\nrugs\nsmall photo album\n\nI save my luxury item for Burn Night. By then I’m living on soups, jerky and boil-in-a-bag Indian curry. A can of duck legs confit is fancy, fortifying and delicious — especially when served on instant mashed potatoes. Add wine and a playa sunset and it’s the height of fine dining.\n\nWhat’s your luxury item? Tell us. We might need it.\n\n*As always, only bring things that will leave no trace and secure your property at all times. Shattered mirrors will definitely leave a trace. And if you love something, leave it at home. The playa eats irreplaceable treasures for breakfast.",
