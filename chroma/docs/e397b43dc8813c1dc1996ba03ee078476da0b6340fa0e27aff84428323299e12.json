  "content": "There is a company that is now renting an internet hub device to ensure that you have broadband cell and internet service while at Burning Man.\n\nI find this deeply upsetting.\n\nSure, there are many reasons why people “need” internet while on playa.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, Burning Man managed to be awesome long before phones worked in the Black Rock Desert.\n\nI’m not going to tell anyone how to Burn. (Okay, that is a lie. I frequently advise on best practices and the importance of the Principles.)   But if you feel the Siren’s song of digital connectivity pulling at you, I strongly encourage you to tie yourself to the mast. Make sure you establish a procedure and have discipline around any phone, internet (or camera) use.\n\nWhy? Smart phones and cameras put Immediacy at risk.  And the Immediacy Principle is the main ingredient in the recipe for Playa Magic.\n\nIn this video, I dig deep into the power of Immediacy, the danger of connectivity, and give some suggestions on how to best be present while on playa.\n\nPlus, bonus talk about how “sex “is a good model for thinking about Immediacy and thoughts on photography consent.\n\nYou can also listen to the 24 min. broadcast on itunes, Sticher, or MP3\nFull transcript here.",
