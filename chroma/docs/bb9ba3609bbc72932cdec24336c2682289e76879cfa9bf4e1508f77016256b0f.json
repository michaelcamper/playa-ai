  "content": "We have been out and about the last couple of weeks visiting some big art that is going to Burning Man this year. First we stopped by to see how Truth is Beauty is progressing. Marco Cochrane, the sculptor, says:\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Truth is Beauty their Indiegogo campaign is HERE.\n\nWhile we were on Treasure Island, I spoke to  Katy Boynton, the sculptor of Heartfullness.  Heartfullness was at Burning Man 2012 for the first time.  It is a 12 by 15 foot steel sculpture of a heart that has been broken and pieced back together, damaged and pieces may be missing, but this weathered heart is stronger and infinitely more interesting. Katy told us they were going to do some small scale testing for adding fire to her piece for the Playa this year, and we got to watch. Gotta love fire!\n\nThe next evening we stopped by American Steel Studios, where they were having a preview for their open studios, which will be open until 5pm today and the gallery is   open for the next couple of weeks by appointment.  Don Cain of the Department of Spontaneous Combustion is building Mens Amplio for Burning Man 2013.  The photo includes a rendering of the installation, the model and the beginning of building the brain.\n\nLots more to come over the next few months.  Click here to read more about the Honorarium Art. 111 days until the Man burns!\n\nvideo: Jenni Nelson",
