Architect Gregg Fleishman’s Otic Oasis is a 35-foot honeycomb structure from Burning Man 2011 and 2012.\n\nWeighing in around 20,000 pounds, Otic Oasis will be re-assembled using a local crew with Kasetsart University student participation under Fleishman’s direction. Wonderfruit is giving Oasis a central position as one of the main stages at the festival’s highest elevation, the Solar Stage, where participants can best enjoy the sunsets and sunrises.\n\nFleishman has designed a structure specific to Wonderfruit, integrating the Otic Oasis and creating view towers for the stage and surrounding countryside.\n\nOtic Oasis’ rhombohedric structure is based on the diamond form of the rhombic dodecahedron constructed within the framework of a 3-D checkerboard of cubes. The “Lost Triangle of Pythagoras,” which defines the diamond shape, is the unifying factor of Fleishman’s design.\n\nFleishman sees this design as a solution to the changing needs of people on a planet under pressure. Such buildings can be disassembled and moved in the face of climate-driven disasters. These geometric portable structures can be scaled using modular components — three stories, five stories or more. “Because everything is modular, geometry allows these buildings to be virtually limitless,” Fleishman says. No nails or metal connectors, just calculated joinery holds Fleishman’s designs in place.\n\nOtic Oasis is the first example of Fleishman’s structures that melded an octahedral space frame structure with the rhombic modules characteristic of his earlier play structures. The purpose of the integration was to go big. The space frame provides the support structure, so the skin or modular network of pods can carry loads in multi-storied structures. The largest structure built in this way was Burning Man’s 2013’s Temple of Whollyness, a project with partners Melissa “Syn” Barron and Lightning Clearwater III.\n\nI met Gregg Fleishman at Burning Man 2016 at his Guild Space in the Piazza under the Man. He offered a math lesson, demonstrating the principle at the core of his architecture.\n\nHe’s currently working on documenting the lost triangle in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFleishman has works in museum collections such as the Yale University Art Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art and the Art Institute of Chicago. He was commissioned in 2014 by Art Villa Garikula, to install one of his buildings on the festival grounds near Tbilisi, Georgia. The installation, called “the American Pavilion,” was funded with a grant from the U.S. Embassy.\n\nFleishman is grateful to the Burning Man community for its support and appreciates the opportunity it provides to showcase his work. “I am trying to spread the knowledge I have about the 3-D cubic world to make building more adaptable to changing needs in these challenging times,” Fleishman says. “Burning Man allows me to continue to evolve and provides a global audience to appreciate the work. I find that as it evolves and expands its own boundaries, it parallels my own development. If I could contribute another Temple design or some structures for Fly Ranch, this fantasy ride would be complete.”\n\n(Top photo: Otic Oasis at Burning Man, photo by Roy Two Thousand)",
