  "content": "Before the pandemic, when Burning Man was in its “High Culture” phase, there was a strong sense that the kind of organizational systems and bureaucracy that work for conventional organizations won’t work well for this culture … and so while we needed systems, we also needed to find a way to “make bureaucracy Burning Man compliant.” Today, with Burning Man in its “Diaspora” phase, we have that same need — just from the opposite direction. Burning Man needs systems that “feel like Burning Man,” that seem native to our culture, in order to keep people connected, keep from reinventing the wheel, support best practices, and help us be greater than the sum of our parts.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018 I held a series of workshops with Burning Man staff and volunteers to ask: what would systems like that look like? How do we imagine a “Burning Man compliant bureaucracy would work?”\n\nThese are the ideas we came up with, some of which I’ve written about before, some of which are presented for the first time.\n\nWhat We Do When We’re Doing It Right\n\nHow do we make bureaucracy Burning Man compliant? We begin by examining Burning Man culture itself, the way Larry did when he established the 10 Principles. We’re not trying to impose our vision of what a “good bureaucracy” is, we’re asking: when Burning Man is working, when everyone is contributing and enjoying themselves and only overworked in meaningful ways … what is it that’s happening? What are the conditions when we get this right? What is our system like when it is working in line with our culture?\n\nWe concluded that the experience of volunteering for Burning Man — when we’re doing it right — succeeds so spectacularly because volunteers access and experience five things that are usually hoarded at the very top of organizations (if they’re offered at all). Over time, I would come to call these “RACER” qualities, mostly because the acronym was sitting right there. They are:\n\nWhen we are able to both experience and do these things, the experience “feels like Burning Man” or at least “rhymes with Burning Man.” Therefore our processes should be designed in such a way as to generate and spread these experiences. Much in the way that people are willing to put up with incredible inconvenience at Burning Man if they see it as a meaningful part of their experience, if it feels like Burning Man, bureaucracy that feels like Burning Man will be seen as part of the experience, rather than something taking them away from the experience, or blocking it entirely.\n\nFor a deeper look at these qualities and how they’re used, read the Burning Man Journal article: “Don’t Bogart That Leadership — Burning Man is not a Zero Sum Game.” (Note that this post is from much earlier in the process, before Engagement was added. Otherwise it’s in line with this discussion.) Leaders in Burning Man culture are fundamentally not people who make decisions for other people, but who help other people access these qualities in the work they do. That’s what our bureaucracy needs to do too.\n\nWhat Does Applying RACER to Bureaucracy Look Like in Practice?\n\nThat’s what we have to figure out, but here are the initial design recommendations that the workshops developed:\n\nThat’s what we’ve got as bullet points. In the next (and last?) post in this sequence, I’ll talk about my own experiences trying to implement approaches like these, and how they did (and didn’t) work out.",
