  "content": "Greetings, friends. Last week we shared this official coronavirus update and this related post from our CEO, Marian Goodell. This week, we’re continuing to gather critical information, reach out to our government partners, and seek guidance from experts. As you all know, there’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty right now.\n\nGiven that reality, we believe the prudent next step is to postpone our upcoming ticket sale. Registration for the “Main Sale” was scheduled to begin April 1, and the sale was set to take place April 8. Effective today, we are postponing the Main Sale registration and the Main Sale. We are going to gather more information over the coming weeks so that we can make a more informed decision. We have not yet set an alternative date for the registration and sale.\n\nWe understand you may have many related questions. We don’t have all of the answers (yet!), but we’re committed to continuing to communicate with you in a transparent and timely manner. One question we know many of you are asking is if Black Rock City 2020 tickets will be refunded in the event of a cancellation.\n\nWe are exploring every possible option for offering refunds if the 2020 event is canceled. Our terms and conditions state that tickets are non-refundable “for any reason,” but we recognize how unusual this situation is, and are sensitive to the financial insecurity many in our community are facing. At the same time, building a city in the desert requires year-round planning and preparation; we have dozens of permanent employees who work full-time creating Black Rock City. We also facilitate year-round nonprofit programming including Burners Without Borders, the Regional Network, and Fly Ranch. Issuing refunds would be challenging for our nonprofit, but we are examining all possible scenarios that would enable all of us to weather this storm.\n\nYou may also be wondering where your ticket money goes. The vast majority of ticket revenue is spent producing Black Rock City. Some of our largest expenses include staffing, fees paid to the federal, state and local government agencies, heavy equipment rental, and porta-potties (for more details check out this pie chart of expenses). That said, in 2012 the Burning Man Project nonprofit organization was established to make Burning Man experiences and values accessible to more people, in more places, more of the time. We are bringing the inspiration, creativity, inclusion, and yes, some of the funds, from Black Rock City out into the world. For more about Burning Man Project’s nonprofit programs and finances, check out our Annual IRS Form 990, more FAQ’s from previous 990’s, and our Annual Report.\n\nThank you so much for your patience and support during this time of continuous change. We know the idea of gathering together in Black Rock City late this summer feels like a beacon of hope to many of you (us too!), but we must prioritize our collective well-being and the health of people around the world.\n\nStay tuned for regular updates – we hope to have more information to share within a few weeks. In the meantime, if you’re looking for some inspiration for staying connected and celebrating Burning Man culture virtually, check out this roundup of stories. And if you’ve initiated or have heard about a great way people are coming together, share it with us here.\n\nHeader image: Box Office at Black Rock City (Photo by SN Jacobson)",
