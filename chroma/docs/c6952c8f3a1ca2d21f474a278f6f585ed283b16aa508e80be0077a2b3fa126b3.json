Though we wish we had better news to share, Larry continues to be in critical condition. His vitals are stable, but Larry is not conscious and we don’t yet know the extent of the damage caused by the stroke. Larry is surrounded by close friends and family, and we all continue to hope for the best possible outcome.\n\nWe are humbled and honored by the outpouring of love and support from the global Burning Man community. We have heard from many people about the importance of prayer and faith in times like these. There is great power in good intentions, and we are filled with gratitude for all of you who are giving us positive energy and hope.\n\nPlease keep Larry in your thoughts. Thank you so much.\n\nThis is a difficult announcement to make. Our founder and friend Larry Harvey is currently hospitalized after suffering a massive stroke on Wednesday, April 4. Larry remains in critical condition. While his prognosis is unknown at this time, Larry is receiving excellent round-the-clock medical care and constant companionship from his family and very close friends.\n\nWe know this news may be startling and saddening for many of you, as it has been for us. Please send your positive thoughts and intentions to Larry and his family. If you feel moved to share well wishes, notes of gratitude, or your best and craziest Larry Harvey stories, feel free to do so respectfully in the comments below. For those who would to like to send messages directly to Larry and his family or share reflections more privately, please email TheHat@burningman.org.\n\nWhile this is a challenging time, we are encouraged by our community’s ability to come together when it matters most. Some have asked how this may affect our organization and our operations going forward. Rest assured, Burning Man and Black Rock City 2018 will go on. If there’s one thing we know for sure, Larry wants us to burn the Man.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more information when it becomes available. In the meantime, we ask for patience and support as we navigate the effects this has on all of us.\n\nThank you for sharing your love with each other, and your love of Burning Man with the world.\n\n(Photo by Philip Safarik)\n(Top photo by Jim Urquhart)",
