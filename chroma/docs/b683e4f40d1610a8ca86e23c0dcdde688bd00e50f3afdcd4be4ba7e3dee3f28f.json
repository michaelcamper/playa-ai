  "content": "Greetings friends!\n\nIt’s been awhile since I’ve posted anything. I just have to share with everyone how freaking excited I am getting about the creation of Everywhere Lane on the playa.\n\nEverywhere Lane is going to be located at 6:15 and Esplanade and is THE place to stop by to find out what is happening in the Burning world year-round.\n\nThe Regional Network Center will be open from 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM daily with real, live Regional Contacts on hand to answer your questions and help you get connected to your local burner community.\n\nBurners without Borders, the Black Rock Arts Foundation and Black Rock Solar will be our neighbors.\n\nWe’re working hard to collaborate and create a unique way to meet the folks working to keep the fires burning year-round.\n\nNot long now. We head out next week to start construction on Everywhere Lane. More coming soon.\n\nUntil then.\n\nGiddyup!",
