  "content": "The OMG Sale is coming up tomorrow, for those who registered. And just like the Individual Sale, there are lot more registrants than there are tickets available.\n\nYep, that’s right … the secret’s out about Burning Man, demand is high, and the reality is that most of you aren’t going to be able to get a ticket. But if you don’t get one in the OMG Sale, don’t despair: be patient, get the word out there, stay connected to your Burner community, and one could very well make its way to you.\n\nSome things to consider when purchasing tickets in the open market:\n\nAnd lastly, keep in mind that Black Rock City is not the only place to get your burn on. There are over 60 Burns happening around the world, including Nowhere in Spain, AfrikaBurn in South Africa, Israel’s Midburn, Flipside in Austin — even one in Korea! And these Burns, like the one in Black Rock City, are just as amazing as you make ’em.\n\nBest of luck in the sale, and we hope to see you on playa.",
