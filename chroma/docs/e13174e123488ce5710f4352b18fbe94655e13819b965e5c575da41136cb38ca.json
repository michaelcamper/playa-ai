  "content": "For two years, Art for Trees has undertaken the admirable task of planting trees to replenish a portion of the wood we burn in Black Rock City’s Temple every year. After planting more than 5,100 trees so far, the project is back for the third time, so you can contribute to replenish the wood for the Temple of Promise.\n\nAppropriately, this year’s Temple will have a stand of sculpted trees in its heart, initially with bare branches, which visitors will drape with messages they’ve written on cloths, creating a shady grove of weeping willows. This Temple is already a tribute to the all-important Burner principle of protecting the environment, so supporting Art for Trees’ efforts this year couldn’t be more fitting.\n\nCheck out the Art for Trees Indiegogo campaign and consider planting some trees in honor of the Temple of Promise.\n\nAnd wouldn’t it be great to see this kind of project become widespread as a way to offset some of the environmental impact of our whole event? Let’s all try to come up with at least one more way to do that this year.",
