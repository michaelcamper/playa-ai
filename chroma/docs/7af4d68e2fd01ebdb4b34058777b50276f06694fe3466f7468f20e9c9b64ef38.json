  "content": "People say, “jump the shark” like it is a bad thing.\nSure, it signified a time in the story arch of Happy Days when things flew off the rails. But it paved the way for Mork, for God’s sake!\nAnd we are talking about FONZIE jumping over a shark. Is there anything more awesome (and Burning Man) than that!?\n\nHell yes, Burning Man “Jumped The Shark” this year. Just like it does every year.\n\nIn this 3 minute video I explain what Pink Heart does on Playa and how it is just one tiny way that we all have live-changing Shark Jump experiences of our own.\n(Warning: If you get triggered by tears, I get misty a minute in.)\n\nWatch the full episode talking about how glorious the dust storms were, more about Pink Heart’s gifts, the surreal presence of Halcyon on Playa, and more.\nOr listen on iTunes.\n\nSong, “The 10 Principles Of Burning Man” – Graham Bolger Mix (with audio samples of me).",
