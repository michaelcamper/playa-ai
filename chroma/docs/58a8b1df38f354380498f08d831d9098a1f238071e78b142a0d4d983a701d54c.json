  "content": "I’m hardly the only person to whom Jay Marx offered a memorable introduction to Washington, DC. Jay passed through this world entirely too briefly, but he touched a great many of us and presented a powerful example of how to apply the principles of conscious counterculture beyond building community to help refashion a new default world.\n\nJay and I first crossed paths in 2002. I’d finished an internship interview with a law firm office on K Street, and stumbled into a peace march that he had helped organize six months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. We went on to organize, perform, and party together in countless settings over the next 13 years before he passed away at Transformus in North Carolina this July.\n\nA Brilliant Young Man\n\nJay pursued his inspiration — learning, connecting with others, and struggling to make the world a better place — his entire life. His mom Diane explains that he started reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at the ripe age of two and taught himself to read at three years old by watching Romper Room and Sesame Street.\n\nIt was also at three years old that Jay made his first declaration of agnosticism. Responding to his mother’s introduction of the concept of prayer by whispering in low tones before bed, he at one point recoiled and yelled, “This is ridicuwous! There’s nobody in this room but you and me.”\n\nAfter his parents divorced, Jay spent summers in Wyoming (first, Cody, then Jackson Hole) with his maternal Uncle Jim, a world champion rodeo bareback rider who took Jay under his belt. Describing his time with his Uncle Jim, Jay wrote once in an email:\n\nLearning his childhood history and his Uncle’s role in his life helped me better understand Jay, whom I sometimes described as a cross between the Marlboro Man and a raging hippy.\n\nIt was during one of his trips to Wyoming that Jay first got his start in theater. His first production, The Pied Piper of Hamlin Town with the Missoula Children’s Theater, saw him playing one of only a few speaking roles, as the town brat. More plays in middle and high school culminated in a role as Danny Zuko in Grease.\n\nIn the 8th grade, Jay took a trip to Washington, D.C., where he would return many years later. When he got home from his school trip, he showed his mom a flyer from a vigil outside the White House protesting the use of nuclear weapons. The vigil began in 1981, and has continued nearly every day since then. It would later come to play a major role in Jay’s adult life.\n\nAfter receiving a full ride, merit-based scholarship among only 10 awarded across the state, Jay studied history at Colorado College. As the Opinions Editor of Catalyst, the school paper, he demonstrated early his lifelong penchant for embracing controversy.\n\nWhen he was done, he put his education to a far greater use than most graduates ever do.\n\nA Prescient Voice for Peace and Justice\n\nJay presented a rare combination of talents. Few people reveal as deep and enduring a commitment to any set of principles. Fewer still combine his intellect, charisma, and sincerity to shine such prolific light in this world.\n\nJay served as the coordinator of the Washington Peace Center (which I served as a member of the Board before he joined the staff, and to which Jay’s family has invited donations in honor of his memory) in the mid-to-late 2000s. He worked to support campaigns, organizations, and communities mobilizing against war and militarism. Returning to his student publishing roots, he distributed the Activist Alert, a resource for the peace movement, while also providing sound equipment for events and guidance on the permit process for visiting activists.\n\nHe also spoke at dozens of events addressing issues from poverty and income inequality, climate change, and money in politics to drug policy, civil rights, and civil liberties. As he said to a crowd of thousands when speaking out against the war in Iraq:\n\nJay was a firebrand, but he was hardly content to hurl invectives at the system from the sidelines. It was Jay’s commitment to peace, among other things, that drove him to New York City to protest the Republican National Convention in 2004. As narrated by our fellow activist and writer, Nat Parry:\n\nA few months before he died, Jay received a five-figure settlement from a court case challenging mass arrests, part of nearly $20 million paid by the NYPD to resolve violating the rights of hundreds of peaceful people arrested, detained, and subjected to unsafe conditions for the “crime” of raising their voices. If speaking out is a crime, Jay was a recidivist.\n\nBeyond speaking and taking action in the streets, Jay was also willing to lay his time on the line. In 2004, he ran for DC City Council, one of half a dozen Green Party candidates. While his candidacy was unsuccessful, he injected powerful ideas into the debate, like full constitutional voting rights for D.C. residents; restoration of a full service public hospital in D.C.; accountability on safe drinking water and other public health issues; and public investment based on the needs of working people rather than the interests of corporate lobbies and real estate developers — just as he always had as an activist.\n\nJay also supported the Anti-Nuclear Vigil outside the White House that inspired him when he visited Washington in middle school. As part of the next generation engaged in the vigil, he moved into the Peace House where the founders lived, and played an important role as they aged. His comments at the vigil’s 25th anniversary reflected his passion and energy.\n\nAfter the founder of the vigil died in 2009, Jay went on a speaking tour with his wife, Ellen. Their Proposition One Campaign roadshow visited military facilities, national parks, and community events across thousands of miles.\n\nTheir visit to Creech Air Force Base in Nevada found Jay working with local activists to challenge the use of armed drones to kill targets (including Americans) without trial. He took a fellow participant to a testing site down the road, where a military helicopter greeted them by hovering above just 25 feet away until they left.\n\nRemixing Many Talents\n\nJay was no mere policy wonk, neither was he simply an inspired person wielding the force of every soapbox he could reach. Nor was he just a comedian, nor merely an actor, nor only a fast friend to anyone. He was all of those things, which made Jay more effective in each of the roles he so joyously played.\n\nAfter struggling for years to find work that aligned with his values, Jay found a job at which he excelled in the green-tech sector. As a Site Auditor for Solar City from 2011 to 2013, he installed renewable energy infrastructure on hundreds of homes in D.C., Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware. As his colleague Chris explained, Jay “learned to survey roofs and layout panels for solar power installations, helping to literally bring power to the people. Unsurprisingly he was a master of client management, always delighting in getting to know customers.”\n\nSoon after I moved to Washington in 2003, we and and a handful of others started the D.C. Guerrilla Poetry Insurgency to host and cultivate politicized spoken word performance. We recruited poets into a creative collective based on principles common to our overlapping social movements, from Burning Man to Occupy: Radical Inclusion, Gifting, Decommodification, Radical Self-expression, Civic Responsibility, Participation, Communal Effort alongside Radical Self-reliance, and reclaiming public space.\n\nJay was one of our most stalwart voices, willing to hit the mic at the drop of a hat, able to thoughtfully improvise while reflecting a range of moods from outrage to hilarity, and always eager to thoughtfully engage a passerby and trade ideas and perspectives. He could could not only talk about more or less any political subject with the fluency of a policymaker, but also do it in a way that would engage listeners rather than alienate them.\n\nThis 2007 video produced by the Backbone Campaign shows Jay demonstrating the power of parody in speaking truth to power:\n\nHe wasn’t afraid to take action, either. In D.C., Jay was frequently at the White House, whether to hold signs promoting the impeachment of war criminals, or to incite visiting student tourists to join him in heckling the President during a Rose Garden press conference.\n\nHe also took action in less prolific places. In 2008, Jay visited Minneapolis to support Vets for Peace during their continuing protest of the Republican National Convention in 2008.\n\n“Incandescent Love”\n\nBut Jay was more than a thinker or a performer — he was also a garrulous and gregarious social superconductor. Jay offered joy and warmth to anyone, which drew people to him, each other, and the movement and counterculture to which he dedicated himself. Our friend Chris described Jay as constantly sharing “incandescent love,” which explains one reason he endeared himself to so many.\n\nWhether at a silent disco by the Cherry Blossom Festival, the U Street Funk Parade, or at a watering hole in the woods, Jay reflected the light of the world and shared it with others.\n\nNotably, Jay’s love was not confined to those he knew personally. He dedicated his life to activism not because he wanted influence nor because he had nothing better to do. He loved people — writ large — so much that he couldn’t stand idly by as institutional crimes compounded all around him. He wasn’t willing to go along to get along. He planted his feet and spoke his — I daresay our — truth.\n\nIn his own words, spoken during a street theatre action on Capitol Hill:\n\nJay’s love also helped him transcend some of the divisions unfortunately so visible today. He was willing to use his privilege strategically to serve others as an ally. As recounted by Nekia Wright:\n\nMy Dear Departed Friend\n\nThe last time I saw Jay was the night before he passed away. It was late on a Saturday night, and he was riding an art car with his girlfriend, passing by a sound camp where I was DJing an early morning set. They ran over to give me a hug before heading home. We had no idea it would be the last time we’d see each other in this life.\n\nHe surprised me two days earlier by simply showing up at Transformus. He’d moved away from D.C., and we hadn’t spoken often, so I didn’t expect him to come bouncing over to the DJ booth on Thursday night during my opening set. Although we’re both hetero men, I gave him a hug, kissed him on the mouth, and told him I’d slip him tongue the next time I saw him. He winked and replied, “Not if I slip it to you first!”\n\nBy the end of the weekend, Jay was gone.\n\nLike all of us, Jay battled with recurring challenges in his life. He had a hard time finding paid work aligned with his values, had a tendency to promise more than he could reliably deliver, and occasionally disappeared without a trace, only to resurface some time later with his trademark crooked grin and an armload of good intentions to smooth any aches.\n\nFor me, what makes his untimely passage most painful is the brightness of the future he was denied. Jay overcame many of his challenges, only to leave us before having a chance to enjoy the life he had built for himself.\n\nA Loss for the World\n\nAfter leaving D.C., Jay moved to North Carolina to build a sustainable Earth-based dwelling with Ellen, the remaining founder of the Peace Vigil that so inspired him when he was younger. Just one month before he passed, his mother Diane came to visit from Colorado. He was understandably joyous at the chance to bring his mothers together.\n\nHe’d also met Delight, a beautiful, brilliant, and charming partner who loved him as much as he loved her. Three months before he passed away, he wrote in an email:\n\n“And now there’s Delight! Beautiful, brilliant, focused, thoughtful, somehow available, and she seems to like…me. In other words, she’s impossible, a miracle, and I’m not sure what else I can really say about the incomparable Delight, other than that I really can’t wait to get to know her better.”\n\nDuring one of our last conversations, he said she amazed him, and that he was so inspired by their relationship that he was thinking of settling down. He said he’d lost interest in other women, and that she might even be out of his league. I told him he was right, but that it was all good as long as he recognized it.\n\nLike his own Uncle Jim, Jay was a devoted uncle to his sister’s two kids, who he won’t have a chance to see grow up.\n\nJay looked forward to his future. So did the rest of us.\n\nThere are no words that can ease the pain of losing a dear friend, let alone a hero who devoted himself to promoting positive values in the default world from which we all work so hard to periodically escape. For me, it has helped to remember that he went out on top, the happiest I’d ever seen him, in a place he adored, and alongside a partner he loved.\n\nWhile our world is dimmer having lost the light of Jay’s profound love, we who were lucky enough to be blessed by it remember his memory and will honor it on the playa, in the streets, and beyond.\n\nRIP, Jay Marx. We miss you, brother.",
