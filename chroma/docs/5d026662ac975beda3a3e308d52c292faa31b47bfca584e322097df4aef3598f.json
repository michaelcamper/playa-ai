  "content": "Striking Roots: The Tree of (Im)Permanence\nby Nick Geurts\n2014 Burning Man honoraria project\n\nThe Tree of (Im)Permanence, a 2014 Burning Man Honorarium Project, is a twenty-foot tall, stainless steel, interactive musical tree. The toy piano its base actuates strikers which play 25 stainless steel bell chimes that hang from the branches of the tree. The piece has been on display outdoors as a temporary installation at the Denver Performing Arts Complex in downtown Denver, Colorado, for the month of January, 2015. The artist is looking for new temporary installation opportunities in the Denver area until October 2015, when it will be permanently installed as a donation at the Shiloh House, a new foster care facility in Centennial, Colorado. Let artist Nick Geurts know if you have any ideas!",
