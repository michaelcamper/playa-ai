  "content": "If you were among those who purchased Burning Man tickets since they went on sale on January 19th, you’ve likely gotten your ticket to paradise in the mail already, or are about to.\n\nWe thought you’d be interested to know a little about this year’s ticket designer. Andrew Jones is a long-time Burner, professional artist and cultural instigator from the Bay Area who constantly innovates his craft and pushes the boundaries between technology and art. He’s passionate about sharing his gifts with his community.\n\nUnlike some digital artists, Andrew uses technology as an accelerator for his visions, rather than a crutch for his limitations. He uses Photoshop, Painter and a Wacom tablet as effortlessly as the rest of us use our hands, and he uses them to incredible effect, manifesting stunning compositions of visual stream-of-consciousness, seamlessly mixing sweeping gestures with intensive detail and powerful imagery.\n\nAndrew chose to have this year’s ticket image tell the story of Burning Man as a rite of passage. It’s the story each of us experiences as Burning Man makes its indelible mark on our lives. When you get your ticket, take a close look at the detail therein … it’s pretty amazing.\n\nTo see more of Andrew’s work, and to learn about his incredible Phadroid live painting performances, visit his website.",
