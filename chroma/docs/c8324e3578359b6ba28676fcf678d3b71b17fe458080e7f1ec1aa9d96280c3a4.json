  "content": "SHOUT OUT to Playa Mike, who posted this inspiring album from Burn Night 2015. Mike says:\n\nThat’s the spirit, Playa Mike (and crew). You made mooping fun. Thank you for leaving no trace, and for picking up more than you dropped. The Playa Restoration crew salutes you!\n\nI’d like to take this moment to remind us all of what moop is [it’s Matter Out Of Place] and why we pick it up [because Burning Man is a Leave No Trace event, and keeping that incredible commitment requires everyone’s participation].\n\nHere’s a nice summary of it, from this year’s Survival Guide:\n\nNo matter how big and crazy our temporary city gets, it’s always going to be a community. And it’s always going to attract awesome people who find their own ways to participate. Including mooping their way through BRC with a tail made of caution tape.\n\nDid YOU pick up moop in a creative, photogenic way this year? Tweet me your photos @jhfearless. I’ll totally RT.\n\nAnd hey guys, I’ve seen Day One of the Moop Map results and I can say for sure that you’re going to see them too, very soon. Tomorrow maybe?",
