  "content": "After two years of fiddling, it is my pleasure to present the completely redesigned AfterBurn, with a new home in the Burning Man Journal.\n\nFor those of you who don’t remember — because honestly, it’s been a while — the AfterBurn is a look back at the past year in all things Burning Man, including the event in Black Rock City, the Global Network, and Burning Man Project operations. The AfterBurn used to be the One Report to Rule Them All, but since Burning Man’s transition to an all-encompassing nonprofit in 2014, we began publishing a swanky Annual Report that provides the high-altitude view of our our vision, impact and health as an organization. It took some time to figure out how to split these things up, but we’ve basically got it now. The AfterBurn is the comprehensive picture of what we did. The Annual Report is about why we did it.\n\nInstead of each AfterBurn representing an enormous, branching section of our website, AfterBurns are now a single, phone-friendlier, scrollable page in the Journal containing many short sections from each Burning Man team, with links for in-page navigation. As these various pieces are published, each year’s AfterBurn intro will link off to that year’s entry on the Burning Man Timeline, its Annual Report, its Event Archive of all the art and camps and stuff, its BRC Census data, its Building BRC series in the Journal, and that year’s MOOP Map.\n\nThe best part of moving to the Journal is that it allows us to embed other blog posts in their relevant sections for further reading. This puts all the great writing and photography generated by our crews year-round to much better use as part of Burning Man history.\n\nThanks for your patience, and please feel free to share your feedback here in the comments.\n\nCheck out the 2017 AfterBurn\n\nTop photo by Shalaco",
