  "content": "A few weeks ago some folks cruising the Venice boardwalk on fuzzy bikes encountered a group of people spinning flow toys on the Venice grassy knoll. Talk about two great tastes that taste great together!\n\nThe following discussions lead to a gathering last weekend of “Hug Nation & Flow Temple” in Venice Beach.\n\nThe day was AMAZING and we hope to do them every 2nd Sunday from now until the Burn.\n\nIt may not have been THE Playa, but there was definitely a Playa vibe in the air. In fact, one of the themes of my Hug Nation talk was cultivating a Playa mindset, year round:\n\nCraft nights? Burner brunches? Playa bike parades?  How do you cultivate a Playa mindset year-round?",
