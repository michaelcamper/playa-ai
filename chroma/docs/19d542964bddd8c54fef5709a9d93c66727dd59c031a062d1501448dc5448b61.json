  "content": "It’s that time of year again, when just like that up goes the first page of fantastic ART that will grace the playa this year.\n\nBeautiful, sublime, large and small, we have it all from Diamonds in the Sky, an Aeolian Pyrophonic Hall, to large expansive spaces and Infinitarium gardens sure make our Metropolis proud. There are Intersections and Monorails to nowhere, a Subway, even a Towering Inferno and various areas of aural and fire spectacular.\n\nThis year we have a Minaret in the Keyhole, a human scale Mant Farm, a new Temple of Flux, a Kinetic Cab Company and the long awaited return of Doctor Megavolt.\n\nNeedless to say, with this small glimpse of what is to come, Black Rock City will be hoppin’ this year.\n\nI’ve just mentioned a small bit of what is in store so CHECK it all out for yourself and get your inspiration on for what YOU will be bringing out to Burning Man this year.",
