  "content": "It’s nearly 2017, which means it’s time to talk tickets.\n\nThe process will be pretty much the same this time around. The biggest change you’ll note is that the price of regular-tier tickets is increasing from $390 to $425.\n\n$390 was introduced as the primary ticket price back in 2012 when we still had tiered pricing in the Main Sale (tiers were $240-$420 that year). Main Sale tickets were $380 in 2013 and 2014 and bumped to $390 in 2015, but our costs have increased each year while our population cap has been the same for the past few years.\n\nIn 2016 we held fast in order to offset the blow of Nevada’s Live Entertainment Tax, which we recognize was a significant burden for ticket buyers. This year, we need to make the move.\n\nOther ticket and vehicle pass prices remain the same, including $190 Low Income tickets, which exist to maintain access to the event for those who can’t afford higher-priced tickets.\n\nVehicle Passes will remain at $80, but you can reduce the cost per person by carpooling or taking the Burner Express. Not only will you avoid needing to buy a Vehicle Pass, taking the Burner Express and collectively organizing ways to get your stuff to BRC will let you avoid waiting in line and reduce the carbon footprint of the event.\n\nJust like last year, there will be a small tier of Pre-Sale $990 tickets and $1,200 tickets for those who can afford to help subsidize the costs of building Black Rock City’s art, architecture and infrastructure. Those tickets will go on sale first.\n\nPre-Sale registration will begin at the end of January. Stay tuned to the Ticket website for the complete schedule and all the nitty-gritty details. As always, the best way to stay informed is to subscribe to (and read!) the Jackrabbit Speaks newsletter.\n\nFor more details about what Burning Man Project is up to as a nonprofit, check out our 2015 Annual Report, and to learn more about how the organization spends money, you can view our interactive pie chart of expenses.\n\n(Top photo by SN Jacobson)",
