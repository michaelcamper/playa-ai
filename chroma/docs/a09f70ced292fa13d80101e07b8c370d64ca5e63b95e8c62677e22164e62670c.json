  "content": "Everyone interprets a Burning Man theme from their own unique perspective, and that’s just as it should be. Yet occasionally someone gets to the heart of the story in ways I couldn’t have imagined when writing it. After all, a theme is just the shell of a story, waiting to be occupied and lived in. And that’s certainly the case with this video from longtime community member and frequent Journal contributor Halcyon. It’s a short but inspiring talk about letting go of certainty and embracing the unknown to create positive change in our lives and in the world. It’s a powerful reminder that moments of great change bring great possibilities, if only we are willing to make our dreams real in the world.",
