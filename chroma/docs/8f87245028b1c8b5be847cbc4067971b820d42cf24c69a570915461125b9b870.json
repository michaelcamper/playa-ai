  "content": "My family has always been a big part of my Burn.\n\nMy brother went with me my first year in 1998, and for the next five.\n\nMy Grandpa was the first to call Burning Man my “congregation” and sent heirlooms with me (like his childhood bible) to burn each year.  I placed his ashes in the Temple in 2007.\n\nMy grandma sewed my first fur pants. (Including a matching fur bag, “because I had left over fabric,” she said.)\n\nAnd when my grandma passed on, my mom became my go-to seamstress for my Playa creations.\n\nI treasure the bonding experiences that my mom and I share each summer as we craft together in preparation for the Burn.\n\nShe helped me sew cushion covers for the Hugmobile, fur covers for my platform boots, and helped create the epic Octobike. (aka “Snuffleoctobike”).\n\nEvery couple years I half-heartedly asked if she would ever want to go to Burning Man.   Truthfully, I didn’t sell it very well – and she showed no interest.\n\nBut something happened this summer.\n\nI showed my mom a video called “Charlie goes to Burning Man.” It showed a man 10 years older than her who gushed about his experience. Then I showed her photos including one of a man wearing a “Halcyon’s Dad” t-shirt. (It was NOT my dad. Just a beautiful white-haired man who painted his hair pink and donned a pink tutu..)\n\nShe said, “If I went, would I get a t-shirt?”\n\nWait. What?! The door was cracked open and I quickly started on preparations to get my mom to the Burn.   (She had a friend that wanted to go badly -an old PTA mom that I grew up with. I realized that if I could make it easy for both of them, it just might happen. )\n\nI had access to 2 tickets. A campmate had decided they did not need a Sani-hut that was reserved (A mobile bungalow with AC). And I figured that with minimal stress, no mechanical requirements, and zero lines, Mom & a friend could shuttle in from Reno on Monday and fly out of BRC on Thursday.\n\nMom (Susie) and Dee came to our last camp meeting in late August. They met campmates and asked lots of questions. “If you are serious,” I told them, “you should come to our last work party.” Susie and Dee showed up early wearing work gloves and spent half a day glue-gunning pink fur to the last of our camp couches. They were participating.\n\nThey were welcomed into Pink Heart completely.\n\nIt is hard to explain what sharing Burning Man with my mom was like.\n\nMy brother has a beautiful family and has given my mom 2 amazing grandsons.\n\nI, on the other hand,  have given my mom a box of pink hair dye and a pink motorhome. Oh, she loves me dearly and is very proud of me. It’s just that, how can a non-Burner ever fully understand that part of your life?\n\nBut I finally got to share my “baby” with her.\n\nIntroducing her to my camp and campmates was like inviting her to meet my secret half-brothers and sisters.\nI may not be able to give her grandkids, but I can extend her family.\n\nIt was a feeling beyond words to be able to invite her “Home” to meet the larger community that I feel so deeply connected to. She quickly felt like they were her family, too.\n\nAnd she got to see me on the Playa.  My highest self.  The way I help lead the camp. The way I gift and hug and love. She got to see the Playa through my eyes and it helped her see me in a way she never had before.\n\nMom had a brief stay, but she dove right in. She went on ice runs for our iced cucumber water bar. She served vegan ice cream. She shared wisdom with my campmates. Together we shared tears.\n\nWe cried together at the Man. We cried together at the Temple. We cried together quite a bit.\n\nBut the most emotional part was when she helped me co-lead my annual Pink Ride.   It is always a highlight for me, but this one was extra special. She rode a pink fur bike by my side as several hundred people dressed in pink rode behind us. All of us saying, “I love you!” to everyone we passed.\n\nWe descended upon Center Camp and filled it with a glorious pink spiral of love. My Playa family and my mom mixed together in tear-flowing, heart-soaring bliss.\n\nA week later, when we both had returned to the default world, I told her, “That ride with you…it was one of the highlights of my entire life.”\n\nWe were both already crying when she said, “It was for me, too.”",
