  "content": "We are aware that many of you are waiting for a response to a number of questions concerning theme camps, turnkey camps, placement of camps, access to tickets, decommodification and a potential erosion of our culture.\n\nThese are some of the questions members of our community have raised:\n\nIs the Burning Man organization profiting off turnkey camps?\nHow did turnkey camps get all their tickets?\nDo turnkey camps get preferential treatment?\nWere people buying blocks of tickets through the Burning Man Project donation ticket program in the days before the event? If so, why?\nAre turnkey camps undermining the practice of Decommodification and Self-Reliance?\nWhat is going to happen to the turnkey camps going forward? Is there accountability for poor behavior?\n\nThe importance of these questions requires collaboration and input from a wide variety of people including staff, theme camp leaders, artists, Regional Network leaders, turnkey camp producers, and participants. We are still gathering information and identifying the most effective solutions.\n\nWe assure you we are listening and discussing real reforms.",
