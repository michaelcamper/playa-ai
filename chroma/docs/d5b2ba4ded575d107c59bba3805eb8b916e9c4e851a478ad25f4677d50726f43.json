  "content": "Since 2002, the Black Rock City (BRC) Census has collected valuable data from Burners that allow us to better understand the makeup of our population on playa. It also lets us track changes in our demographics, expenditures, behaviors, and attitudes from year to year. In 2023, more than 160 hard-working and dedicated volunteers completed more than 543 shifts to support the Census team in collecting data from randomly-selected participants entering the event through Gate Road, the Burner Express buses, and the Black Rock City airport.\n\nData from the random sample are manually entered by our volunteers on playa, and are used to statistically adjust the results of the post-event BRC Census online survey to represent the population of BRC citizens more accurately. If you attended Burning Man in 2023 and were one of the 7,712 Burners who completed the 2023 BRC Census online survey, thank you for gifting us your data!\n\n2023 Preliminary Results\n\nOur random sample comprises responses from Burners who consented to completing a short eight-question Census survey form with demographic questions collected on playa. Results from this random sample are considered preliminary, and will be validated by the results of the 2023 online survey in a full data report that will be updated in 2024.\n\nAs shown in our data dissemination sheet above, the preliminary random sample results indicate the following:\n\nCompared to last year (2022), it would seem that 2023 participants had similar gender and age distributions, as well as a comparable distribution in place of residence outside of Black Rock City. These observations will be validated upon full analysis of the 2023 Black Rock City Census online survey results.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this preliminary sneak peek of our 2023 Census data, and keep an eye out for our full data report that will be updated in 2024!
