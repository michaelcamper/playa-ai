  "content": "Tom “Driver” Bates’ first Burn was 2006, and like a lot of first-time Burners, on the long drive home, he and his friend “didn’t speak for the [entire] first day.” Playa will do that to you.\n\nBut after a good night’s rest, “all we did was talk the entire way.”\n\nWhat did their conversation circle around?\n\n“Let’s see what we can do.”\n\nThey had the base to a mutant vehicle. They just needed inspiration. “We wanted a mutant vehicle that reminded people of their childhoods,” Driver recalls. That’s when they landed on the focus of their nostalgia, an item that would become their calling card and become an iconic Black Rock City art piece:\n\nThe Wonder Horse.\n\nSince 2008, the plastic spring horses Driver and his friends played on as children have served as the mighty steeds pulling a stagecoach dubbed The Wonder Wagon.\n\nBut The Wonder Wagon was only the beginning of their contribution to the culture of Black Rock City. Their home on playa, Wonder Camp, has become a place where you can “bring your broken bicycle, art project, or mutant vehicle.” If it’s broke, they might not be able to fix it, but they damn sure will try.\n\nSince 2007, Wonder Camp and its crew have repaired hundreds of structural, mechanical, and electrical problems. Need proof? Just peruse their logbook, which lists every problem Black Rock City inhabitants have brought to the camp over the years, including: “who broke it, who do you blame, did [they] repair it, and how many burns have you attended.”\n\nAs the camp co-lead Rosie says, “The fun part is helping other Burners.”\n\nWonder Camp’s primary gift to Black Rock City has been their ability to fix almost everything. But the truly miraculous thing has been their ability to bring new friends and participants into the fold.\n\nInspired by what Driver and his crew created, new Wonder Campers followed their own inspiration to add to the camp’s interactivity. The Siren Salon Spa offers full beauty and massage service, allowing visitors to leave with not just repairs, but fabulous nails to boot. They’ve even built their own printing shop, alternately called “Splinter the Printer” and “Iron-on Maidens.”\n\nWonder Camp has come a long way from a mere gleam in Driver’s eye back in 2006. It just goes to show that in Black Rock City, magic is never in short supply.",
