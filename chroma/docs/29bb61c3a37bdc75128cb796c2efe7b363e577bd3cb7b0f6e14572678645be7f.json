  "content": "As a manifestation of the I, Robot theme, the 2018 Man base experience will offer an exploration of humankind’s decidedly mixed feelings about algorithmic intelligence, cybernetic augmentation, and the mystery of what it means to be human in an increasingly automated world.\n\nThe 2018 Man will be positioned atop an enormous gear, a nod to the passing machine age wherein were forged many of our hopes and fears about artificial life. Inside the structure, murals and bas-relief panels, ancient and modern in aspect, will trace the progression of our enduring fascination with robots, from the primordial golem to the post-work future.\n\nBy night, a phantasmagoria of AI-themed imagery will be projection-mapped onto the Pavilion’s interior walls. Australian artist Joe Crossley and his AstralProjekt & Heckler team will be producing and curating a collection of media art exploring emerging ideas of coexistence between man and machine: IAMAI.\n\nIAMAI is legal declaration of coexistence between man and machine, formed as a living AI media art installation that will show you visions of the AI future, featuring artists from around the world each night after sunset. The ethos is to create audio visual ceremonial space where we can acknowledge and celebrate the declaration of coexistence between man and machine implanting metadata of the declaration in everything you see and hear. Join us and make peace with your robot brothers and sisters.\n\nDigital media artists are encouraged to submit files to the IAMAI project team for consideration and possible inclusion. More information is available at the IAMAI web portal. The submission deadline for contributing artists is Midnight Pacific Time on August 15, 2018.\n\nAs a crowning touch to this year’s Pavilion experience, high atop the gear’s upper viewing platform, a dozen fanciful robots, cyborgs, androids and mandroids will stand vigil around the Man. These “BurnBots” are destined to go up in flames on Burn Night, perhaps to achieve a fleeting singularity with the Burning Man.\n\nThanks and grateful appreciation to the artists whose work was selected for this year’s Man Pavilion:\n\nAnnabel Lee Allen (Ashland, OR): Robotopod Inclusions\n\nNicole Balestrere (Las Vegas, NV): Xochipilli\n\nGogo Bernhard (Vienna, Austria): Soundscape\n\nKelly Smith Cassidy (South Lake Tahoe, CA): Creu Hudol (“Magical Being”)\n\nAileen Cormack (Santa Rosa, CA): AndroBot: Making Garbage Great Again\n\nJoseph Crossley & AstralProjekt/Heckler (Australia): IAMAI\n\nJohn Cruz & Sebastopol Catbot Collective (Sebastopol, CA): Catbot\n\nTyler Garrett & Synchronous Artists (Wichita, KS): Prognostication Protocol\n\nAlexander Griffin (Portland, OR): Squidartha\n\nLeland Johnson & Black Rock Robotics (Casper, WY): Mel’s Makerbot\n\nAndrew Johnstone (Oakland, CA): Murals, Craic\n\nTricia Kelly (Oakhurst, CA): I, Musician\n\nLeonid Kim (Moscow, Russia): Cyber Fossils\n\nChelsi Linderman (Lehi, UT): Robot Gothic\n\nAnna-Gaelle Marshall & Dusty Visions (Portland, OR): Robot Family\n\nDana Mosiman (Sedgwick, KS): Wendigo Electrafryed\n\nDavid Normal (Stinson Beach, CA): Succubus\n\nKate Raudenbush (New York, NY): Future’s Past Circuitry Patterns\n\nMarco Turrubiartes (San Diego, CA): Killbot No More\n\nTrevor Twist (Oakland, CA): Bare Heart\n\nTop image by Andrew Johnstone",
