  "content": "I went to the U.S. premiere of Robin McKenna’s beautiful and cinematic feature length film “GIFT” at the Castro Theatre, San Francisco.\n\nI was joined by special guests John Law (Suicide Club, Cacophony Society), Marina Gorbis (Institute for the Future), Holly Million (Artists United), and DPW Playa Restoration’s very own DA.\n\nHere’s a glimpse of the premiere and the gorgeous and compelling stories of how gifts are given and the Burning Man principle of Gifting thrives in four different corners of the world. The Black Rock City portion of the film was shot in 2013. From the film’s website:\n\n“GIFT is a tribute to something that can’t be measured or counted, bought or sold. Exploring the parallels between artists’ work and a gift economy, it’s a reflection on the creative process, the reasons we ‘labour in service of our gifts,’ and a celebration of the imagination.”\n\nEnjoy.\n\nCouldn’t make the SF premiere? You’re in luck. The Los Angeles premiere is on Wednesday, December 5, and the Boulder premiere is on Saturday, December 8.",
