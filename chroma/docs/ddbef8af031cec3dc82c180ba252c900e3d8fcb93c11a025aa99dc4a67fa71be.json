  "content": "As you’re preparing to hit the road to Black Rock City, take a moment to grab this year’s Audio Art Tours brought to you, as always by the ultra wonderful folks at the ARTery.\n\nYou can load up these mp3s and be the learned one in your group to give details of all the amazing art that’s in store for you this year when some one asks, “I wonder what THIS one is called?”\n\nFrom the Bathroom Beacons to Neverwas Haul, we have it all.  And while you’re out there, I highly recommend  trying to get on one of the ARTery art tours that leave from the ARTery daily. Stop by on the Esplanade and reserve a space the day before since space is limited. They’re a whole hecka fun and a great way to spend an hour or two.\n\nGuides: Jim Tierney, Evonne Heyning\n\nWritten by: Jim Tierney, Douglas Wolk (and the respective artists)\n\nhttp://www.burningman.com/installations/13_art_tours.html\n\nAnd here’s more about how great these tours are https://blog.burningman.com/2012/09/eventshappenings/next-year-take-an-art-tour/",
