  "content": "AfrikaBurn — South Africa’s annual Regional Burning Man Regional Event — kicks off today. As we write, 9,500 Burners from around the world are building Tankwa Town, a temporary creative community at Quaggafontein Farm in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The event’s 2023 theme is Space, which invites participants to “embark on a journey through universes, to new worlds, through a glimmering wormhole and out the other side.”\n\nRoxane Jessi participated in AfrikaBurn in 2018 — and she’s back there again this year. We thought it would be timely to share her photos and poetic impressions of AfrikaBurn, as described in Once Upon a Time in the Dust: Burning Man Around the World.",
