  "content": "I was trying to decide what to do and go to each day . Not only did that take up much of my time in planning mode it also did not necessarily work out. One day I decided to plan but just be open to whatever came up. I planned to attend a talk by a Buddhist Monk at Sacred Spaces but arrived early and did not know which of three domes he might be starting his talk in. There was no indication of the correct dome so I just randomly picked one.\n\nA Jewish man was concluding his talk and I took a place on the floor next to a serious looking young man. We exchanged brief hellos but nothing else. The next speaker came in and announced her talk was on ESP. I decided to stay because I was comfortable and had no desire to move but I also had no interest in her subject matter. I had long ago explored this subject in great detail and felt very complete with it. I decided to just stay to enjoy the moment. It became obvious to me that the young serious man had come just for this talk and that the subject was important to him for whatever reason. I became more interested in his involvement than with the speaker.\n\nAt the end of the talk she opened up a question and answer time but seemed more interested in leaving and moving on. He seemed to have waited just for this moment, to ask his important questions. The two of them were not a vibrational match and I sensed his great disappointment. She moved on quickly but he lingered gathering his belongings. I felt drawn to offer him one of the gifts I had made and to offer to listen again to his question at a deeper level. First, I offered my gift, which was an arm cuff I had spent months making with symbols of the divine to match the Cargo Cult theme. Then I asked him to repeat his question. I listened intently. I could feel his deep confusion about his life situation and I offered what came to me to say.\n\nAfter I finished he said, “I also have a gift for you.” He reached in his bag and brought out a tiny vial of water. He said, “this is from the River Jordan, I am from Israel.” This helped me to understand the deep confusions he was feeling about his life. We never exchanged names. We did not need to.\n\nby Gypsy Crone",
