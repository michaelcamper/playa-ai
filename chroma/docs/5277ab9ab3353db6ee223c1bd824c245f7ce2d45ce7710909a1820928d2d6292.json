  "content": "Placement’s 2024 Statement of Intent (SOI) closed in January with nearly 1,300 submissions from theme camps that wish to be placed in Black Rock City (BRC) this year. That’s 100 more than in 2023, including 152 new theme camps. This shows that our community is alive and strong and we’re going to have another great year full of the interactivity BRC is celebrated for. We’re excited to see what the community is cooking up!\n\nAs we begin planning for the year, we are also looking to the future to understand how Placement should manage continued growth in the number and size of theme camps in BRC. In 2022 and 2023, we placed approximately 90% of BRC. At this percentage, we are truly hitting the maximum number of camps that can receive placement, while still preserving access to tickets and space for unregistered groups and individuals, who are also critical to keeping Burning Man’s culture strong.\n\nHere is a snapshot of the placed camp areas (highlighted in gray) from 2013 compared to 2023:\n\nIn “A Turning Point for Placement,” published in 2019, we said, ”For the first time, there’s not enough room for everyone wishing to be placed.” Back then, we placed about 78% of BRC, leaving only 22% for open camping. We chose to continue to place all camps that met placement criteria that year — with the understanding that the system will need an overhaul to maintain open camping as a viable option in the future. We recognized the importance of stability and predictability for the community immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that we’re fully back in the saddle, we must address this head on.\n\nTicket Supply and Demand\n\nStewards Sale allocations for 2024 were announced to theme camps last week. While we did our best to meet the requests, we were only able to meet 76% of the total requests and do not have additional Stewards tickets to cover them all. Among returning theme camps in 2024, 35% requested an increase to their previous allocation, while only 5% have requested decreases. This poses a growing challenge to meeting demand with a limited supply, and we’re near a breaking point.\n\nWhile we support the limitless passion and creativity produced by theme camps, we face real limits for tickets and space. Welcoming more groups into the Stewards Sale each year means a correspondingly smaller slice for the general public (Main Sale) and other groups such as artists and mutant vehicles. Burning Man Project is committed to keeping the event accessible to new groups of Burners to keep the culture thriving. After all, we all were once new, no matter how long we’ve dedicated ourselves to the Burn.\n\nThe Stewards Sale began in 2013 (formerly called Directed Group Sale). Over the last decade, the allotment for theme camps that receive directed tickets has grown every year. In 2013, ~16% of all tickets to BRC were directed to theme camps; in 2023, that grew to ~40% (a 250% increase over the decade). The following graphs show how much things have grown over the last decade, and demonstrate why continued growth in the size of and number of placed theme camps is not sustainable.\n\nTotal # of placed camps by type:\n\nEstimated Self-Reported Population within All Placed Camps:\n\nTotal # of camps over 100 people:\n\nTotal # of new theme camps vs. theme camps taking the year off:\n\nAs interest in the Burning Man event in BRC continues to grow, more camps continue to seek placement as a way to offer their gifts of interactivity, and also to secure tickets. At the same time, camps are not taking years off at the same rate to offset the growth in new camps.\n\nMeeting Our Cultural Vision\n\nIn addition to increasing demand for space for theme camps, we’ve also been working since 2020 to roll out changes to BRC’s Placement process to help our community move towards the Cultural Vision of Resident Black Rock City. Check out the changes so far outlined on this webpage.\n\nBurning Man Project is now considering tough questions:\n\nScarcity is real. In our daily lives, we’re increasingly confronted with limits to the natural ecosystem we all inhabit. We also confront it in our temporary home in BRC. As we rethink how we can overhaul the system to address our limits, we want changes to be productive and beneficial to the culture of BRC for years to come.\n\nHere is a summary of changes you can expect this year to further our cultural vision as well as address how we manage supply and demand.\n\nTaking the year off comes with benefits, including time to rejuvenate and lighten the stress that comes with planning for the Burn. It also allows you to focus on other ways to bring Burning Man and your theme camp to the world, including visiting one of the many Official Regional Events around the world. This offer is for returning theme camps in good standing that have received at least three years of placement in BRC and who plan to return as the same camp (name, format, people). We want to support the rest and return of our most seasoned theme camps.\n\nThis offer comes with some qualifiers about your allotment for good standing and availability for placement. Contact us for more information.\n\nIf you’ve already submitted an SOI for 2024 with the intent of coming to BRC, and want to take 2024 off knowing this, please email placement@burningman.org with the name of your camp and “2024 Off” in the subject line so we can update our records.\n\nWe are removing the “village” category as a camp type. This shift will help us build direct relationships with smaller camps within villages, and enable us to hold them to the same expectations as other placed theme camps. Resources such as Stewards Sale tickets and Work Access Passes will flow directly to camps rather than through a village mayor. This change also allows for departments such as Rangers, Emergency Services, PETROL, and Outside Services vendors to locate camps.\n\nAs we announced previously, Humans Uniting for Better Sustainability or HUBS are designed for camps to create communities of shared resources. Some individual camps in former villages may want to apply to be part of a HUB. HUBS are not automatically accepted. If you’d like to learn more about how this change will be implemented over the next year, please review a list of frequently asked questions here.\n\nWhile most camps in BRC are theme camps that offer fun interactivity, some also offer critical services that we want to promote. We are creating the “Civic Support Camp” category to recognize a growing need for groups to receive placement to support our community and city services beyond simply fun activities typically associated with theme camps. If you’d like to be considered a Civic Support Camp, you will need to be sponsored by a BRC department, which will support coordination of your civic contributions. This is a trial concept we will review in two years.\n\nOur website currently holds important information about what we’re doing to curb the various threats we see caused by the commodification of BRC including “Decommodification, Gifting, Participation and PAYticipation.”\n\nFollowing the 2023 event, Placement has notified 12 camps that they are not in Good Standing due to convenience camping related issues. In the coming year, we will continue to provide guidelines around what’s okay and not okay in support of Burning Man’s Decommodification principle, and ensure that we are fairly assessing the issue.\n\nCamps that are found at any point during the year to be acting as convenience camps will go through progressive steps and consequences including:\n\nAs always, camps will be able to appeal decisions made. The Placement team genuinely welcomes dialogue to align the community and the culture.\n\nMoving Forward and Making Space within Limits\n\nWe are asking every theme camp to evaluate their desires for growth now, and to consider taking time off in the next few years, or even alternating years of being larger or smaller. Taking time off helps create more space and tickets for others. While we could come up with new policies to address this, we’d prefer each theme camp determine how to do their part.\n\nThere is no penalty for taking a year or two off, and we hope this year’s promise to hold a specific amount of tickets and space is a helpful incentive. Many theme camps believe that they must return each year to qualify for placement the following year, which is not true. Theme camps in good standing still have access to tickets and space upon their return. Theme camps have also shrunk one year and grown back in others without penalty.\n\nWe also hope BRC’s largest camps work on downsizing to help ease demand. Larger camps are often laden with logistical complexity, struggle with accountability across campers, require larger budgets that can bump up against our Decommodification principle, and are more prone to not being self-reliant. Smaller camps bring some of the most wonderful bespoke experiences, and operate with more accountability and ease — something we wish to steer more camps towards in the community.\n\nThroughout the event’s history, we have always adapted to changing dynamics, forces and interests. We are at another point of iteration and we need to do it carefully. With our future presenting more questions than answers, one thing is certain: the BRC community solves problems head-on! Co-creating and adapting is what we do. We do it in dust storms and in rain storms, and we know we’ll be able to come out of this even better equipped to help our culture flourish and evolve.",
