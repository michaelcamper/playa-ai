  "content": "Groovik’s Cube, a reincarnation of a 2009 playa installation, is now on display as part of the 40th anniversary celebration of the invention of the Rubik’s Cube in Jersey City. You can actually play the 26-foot-high light-up cube live via webcam from the Groovik’s Cube website. How cool is that?\n\nMike Tyka and a team of Burners from Seattle built the original Groovik’s Cube in less than five months on an out-of-pocket budget of $20,000. It has about 15,000 components. Since the 2009 Burn, the Cube has been on public display for more than a year.\n\nForget today’s 40th anniversary Rubik’s Cube Google Doodle. That’s just a virtual cube. Go play the 26-foot Groovik’s Cube hanging over people’s heads!\n\nAnd check out this cool video of the Groovik’s Cube being built:",
