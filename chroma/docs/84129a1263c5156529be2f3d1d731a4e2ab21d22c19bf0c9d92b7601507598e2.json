  "content": "“I’m excited. Let’s have a party!” Peter Hazel bursts into the room where a few of his crew members are having a serious discussion regarding their upcoming fundraising events for their honorarium piece, Bloom.\n\nPeter is the kind of guy with a permanent beaming smile and real joy swirling around him. His crew describe him as relentlessly positive. He’s always pushing what is possible: a little bigger, a little more. He has one goal for his team: “Have fun.” He wants his work to be a labor of passion and love surrounded by jokes and happiness. If you stress, you go home.\n\nAnd that labor of love is a 40-foot-tall jellyfish, which will be covered in 2,000 handmade glass mini-jellyfish to form a 30-foot-wide jelly bloom.\n\nThe Outsider Artist\n\nPeter worked as a granite and tile contractor for 35 years. He never had anything to do with art, never took a single art class, but people often ask, “What art school have you gone to?”\n\n“Construction guys don’t get enough credit,” says Peter, who wants people to recognize the “outsider artist” — the one with zero background in the arts.\n\nBut Peter’s background working in tiles was the perfect segue to his work as a sculptor. “We all do it because we can’t not do it,” he says.\n\nSix years ago Peter went to Barcelona, where he was inspired by the creations of famous Spanish architect Gaudi. And that experience shifted his life path forever.\n\nAfter returning from Spain, Peter started creating a plethora of tile and glass sculptures. Initially his kids thought their dad had lost it, but this never deterred Peter. His obsession and passion drove him to create gigantic trouts, larger-than-life daffodils, a massive manta ray and his spectacular work for last year’s Burning Man, Octavius, a 25,000-pound octopus covered in thousands of handmade tiles.\n\nTaking a Leap\n\nNow Peter has made an even bigger leap, one he says is “scary as hell”. He’s quit his job to become a full-time artist, and he has thrown himself fully into his newest work, Bloom.\n\nThe process takes recycled defective glass that the crew smashes up and fuses together to make discs. Each piece is fired in the kiln twice: once to make the disc and then back into the kiln to slump and make the final jelly form. It will take eight kilns running 24 hours a day, seven days a week until Burning Man to create all of the glass for this project.\n\n“Glass is just incredible, and how fitting is it — a glass jellyfish?” says Peter.\n\nK2 engineering helped the team design the internal, interactive steel structure for the enormous jellyfish, which will be covered in 1,400 lineal feet of LEDS to create a beautiful glowing effect.\n\nParticipants will be able to crawl through the tentacles and climb the stairs to the first steel platform inside the jellyfish. From there, they can continue to the interior of the jelly head, which will have a massive platform with a grid flooring so thrill-seekers can peer down 40-foot drop to the playa below.\n\nHelping Out\n\nThe project is still seeking volunteers. If you live in the Reno area, and you’d like to join a great, low-key crew focused on fun, visit the Peter Hazel Facebook page and send them a message. They’re a small, dedicated team and, as they say, ”We’re here for the art.”\n\nTheir philosophy is that people can do whatever they want while volunteering on the project, and there’s many areas where you can learn and grow: from metal fabrication and glass work to making small clay jellyfish medallions that they plan to gift on the playa.\n\nBloom currently has a crowd-funding campaign, and they need to raise a minimum of $25,000 to complete their project.
