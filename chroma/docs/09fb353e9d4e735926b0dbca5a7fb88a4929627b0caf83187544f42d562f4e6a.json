  "content": "Hello friends and community members,\n\nAs I reflect on 2024 and look forward to 2025 I feel an immense sense of gratitude, purpose, and optimism.\n\nI keep coming back to a memory of 1997; we were in a tough place, our first major crisis as an organization. If you were there in 1996, you’d remember the city was a mess. We were doubling in size every year, and things frankly just broke. So, following the mayhem of 1996 we moved the event to nearby Fly Ranch, the one and only time we held the event at Fly. Our troubles compounded when 100% of gate revenues were impounded by the sheriff’s office, which threw us into debt for the first time.\n\nIn retrospect, this was one of the best things that could have happened to us as an organization, and as a community. Let me explain…\n\nMoving to Hualapai Playa and the adjacent Fly Ranch, which was private land, meant we had to comply with a number of laws and regulations that we had never had to deal with on public land. This forced us to learn strategic city planning. It was the first year we had to have a city map with mapped streets, street names, and street signs. We learned how to spatially optimize a street grid for transit, we learned how wide a county-compliant street should be. We learned that it was important to print the names of streets on BOTH sides of the street sign. We learned.\n\nHolding the event on private land, we chose to incorporate as a Limited Liability Corporation. This forced us to start operating as a business. We had to professionalize our rudimentary processes and systems. We grew up.\n\nFaced with this challenging situation the founders and the community committed even more deeply. We came together.\n\nThe next year, 1998, with a more efficient and organized organization, when we made it back to the playa we built a street map, and a stronger community — and it was fucking awesome.\n\nJust as the challenges of 1997 forced us to reimagine what was possible and ultimately made us stronger, today’s moment of change has created unprecedented space for reinvention. We have something now that we didn’t have in 1997: the collective wisdom of our global community, tens of thousands of passionate creators, and decades of proven resilience. When I look at the extraordinary energy and ideas already building for 2025, I don’t just hope — I know — this will be the best Burning Man ever, because each of us has the power to shape what comes next. The future of Burning Man is quite literally in our hands.\n\nA THANK YOU\n\nAs we prepare for what promises to be a transformative year ahead, I want to pause and express my deepest gratitude to each of you.\n\nThank you for being part of our amazing Burning Man community. I am so saddened in the wake of the fires in Los Angeles County, which are on track to be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. My heart goes out to those who experienced extreme loss, and those of us feeling the many direct and secondhand impacts.\n\nOver the last two weeks I’ve received emails, texts and calls that give me hope — reminding me why I love being part of this Burning Man community. I have been heartwarmed by the stories of Burners helping each other. One friend reflected that the ephemeral nature of BRC brought her hope that her community would rebuild after her neighborhood burned.\n\nLocal camps have rallied to support the LA community by providing vehicles with shower supplies, setting up countless grassroots fundraising campaigns to support community members who have lost their homes, and managing communication channels between fire spotters and the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nBurner-affiliated organizations, Solar Punks and Footprint Project (members of both have attended and contributed to Green Theme Camp summits, Burners Without Borders campouts on Fly, deployed solar for art projects on playa and were also supportive in North Carolina after the hurricane and floods in October) are mobilizing innovative renewable energy solutions to power residents’ critical medical equipment, lighting needs, internet hubs, and provide related emergency support for first responders in affected areas.\n\nIn times like these we need each other more than ever. There are so many who have, in the last 12 months, experienced loss in a natural disaster such as the recent fires in LA or Hurricane Helene, or extreme hardship and displacement from geopolitical conflict. We know that Black Rock City can be healing for those who have experienced loss and grief. The Resilience Ticket opportunity will make it easier for anyone affected by these challenges to come home to Black Rock City this year. More information will be included with the launch of ticket sales in the first week of February.\n\nThank you for your generous gifts. I need to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to our recent philanthropic efforts, whether you donated, shared our messages, or acted as an ambassador for our mission.\n\nWith the support of thousands of generous community members, our $3M December Community Campaign has been a success. We exceeded our fundraising goal and saw a 20% increase in the number of donors from 2023 to 2024. While this is certainly something to celebrate, we didn’t meet the fundraising goal we set for ourselves. This has forced us to take a hard look at how we operate, how we fundraise, and what our priorities need to be going forward.\n\nFISCAL RESPONSIBILITY & BLACK ROCK CITY\n\nAs I’ve shared in past letters to the community (Oct. 3, Oct. 22, Oct. 31 & Dec. 19), the reduction in sales of certain tiers of tickets in 2024 and coming in shy of our 2024 fundraising target led us to take drastic actions.\n\nWhen we saw lower ticket demand last June, we immediately cut discretionary spending. We stopped all fixed asset improvements, paused new projects and limited travel. Seasonal hiring was slowed, and in July all department heads were directed to reduce all expenses. After the Burning Man event, we had a formal reduction in force (RIF), reducing headcount by 10%. We renegotiated key contracts and cut expenses throughout the organization.\n\nWe are still closing our books for 2024 (our financials will be published later this year in our federal Form 990 filing and on our website), but the gist of it is this: overall, cash-in was down approximately 16% from the plan (all your donations really helped to reduce the gap), and the resulting savings from spending cuts were approximately 9% from our original plan for the year. What does this mean? We ended up losing money in 2024.\n\nWhile we still are moving toward a long-term vision for Burning Man, including a bright future for year-round programming, our current priority is the Burning Man experience in Black Rock City. We believe helping people get access to Black Rock City plays a critical role in our mission to “facilitate and extend the culture that has emerged from the Burning Man event into the larger world.” We will continue to tightly manage operating expenses and capital expenses across the organization. I look forward to sharing our progress as we move forward.\n\nHOW WE’RE ALL GOING TO MAKE THIS THE BEST BURNING MAN EVER!\n\nEvery great evolution in Burning Man’s history has come from junctures like this — we can together ask not just what we want to preserve, but what we want to become.\n\nRight now, we stand at the threshold of a new frontier. The world is rapidly changing, and Burning Man’s role in that world has never been more vital. This isn’t just about weathering challenges — it’s about harnessing our collective creativity, wisdom, and radical spirit to shape a shared experience that speaks to where we are and to the future we’re moving toward.\n\nThe magic of Burning Man has always been in its ability to evolve while staying true to its core principles, and that evolution has always been driven by you — the community that dreams up the impossible and then makes it real. This year, that transformative power is in all of our hands. Together, we have the chance to write the next chapter of Burning Man’s story, one that responds to the needs of our time while creating new possibilities for human connection and cultural transformation.\n\nLooking back, the burn in 2024 was damn good, especially after two challenging years of difficult weather. The vibe was great and morale remained sky-high throughout the week, sunrises and sunsets were spectacular and it was bookended by smooth ingress and egress that led to making Black Rock City rock on all levels.\n\nWe’re excited to share a number of specific operational updates with you that will carry forward the energy and make this year even better. We’re determined to make things easier for those of you who bring your creativity to life on the playa:\n\nThis is a community-based ecosystem. When you choose your ticket tier, you have an opportunity to have an impact on our collective experience\n\nWe are close to announcing our ticket sales and I can tell you now that there will be lower-priced tickets for those who cannot afford the baseline ticket price, and higher-priced tickets for those who feel excited to expand access for others to Black Rock City.\n\n2025: #BestBurningManEver\n\nAll this improvement is riding with the flow of some incredible early momentum. The first sign of that excitement is receiving interest from the largest number of theme camps ever expressing their intention to participate in BRC in 2025! Woot! #Bman2025!\n\nSo much of what we are crafting came from your input. Thank you for all your ideas and feedback so far. Keep it coming, and thank you!\n\nAs we imagine how incredible the 2025 Burn will be, we want to make sure all your voices are heard. What ideas do YOU have around what could improve in Black Rock City in 2025? What are the challenges and opportunities YOU see? You can send your thoughts to: feedback at burningman dot org.\n\nTOMORROW TODAY\n\nIn thinking about this year’s theme, Tomorrow Today, I’m reflecting on this moment we’re in, both as a community and as a species, and as we plan for the best Burning Man ever, I come back to one of my favorite quotes from Larry Harvey:\n\n“Burning Man is a reminder that we are capable of creating the world we want to live in.”\n\nThank you again for being part of this incredible event, community, and culture. Come create the world with us.\n\nWith gratitude and love,\n\nMarian Goodell\nCEO, Burning Man Project\n\nP.S. Edited listening to The Smiths “How Soon is Now” with a little of The Cure for dessert.\n\nP.P.S. Burning Man is over. #bestburnever #fuckyourburn #burningmansucksdontgo #nosocialmedia #burningmanlovesyou\n\nP.P.P.S. Takes a village to bring a message like this out to the world. Deep gratitude to over a dozen humans who drafted, edited, researched, fixed web links, made web pages, gnashed teeth, edited again, and pestered me. Thank you! ❤️",
