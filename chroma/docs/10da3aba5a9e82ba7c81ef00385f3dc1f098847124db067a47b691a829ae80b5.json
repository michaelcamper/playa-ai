  "content": "In August 2021, we published our Radical Inclusion, Diversity, & Equity Anti-Racism Pledge. We set some short and long-term objectives, and asked: What would it look like for Black Rock City and all of our global communities to be more radically inclusive and diverse?\n\nA year and a half later, so much has happened — members of the community have stepped up to build art pieces, create theme camps, write stories and produce videos, and perhaps most importantly, share the best of our culture and bring new faces into the fold in Black Rock City 2022. Thank you for everything you have done and continue to do!\n\nIt’s important to acknowledge again that publishing and sharing this pledge was in no way the start of the journey — plenty of individuals and groups in the wider culture have been working to make the Burning Man community reflect its full diverse potential for years. We’re grateful for all the conversations, initiatives, and pushes that motivated us to get the pledge together and to bring more organizational support to these topics. Many of those people have also continued to contribute to our R.I.D.E. work in myriad ways.\n\nWe wanted to give you an update on our progress from the last 19 months, and shine the light on some amazing things from within the community.\n\nPlease note that this piece does not and cannot cover the totality of the work being done — there are probably things we don’t even know about! If you are involved in or you know of a project, a group, or an initiative related to diversity in the Burning Man community and it’s not highlighted below, please leave a link and some information in the comments.\n\nUPDATE ON OUR YEAR ONE GOALS\n\nIn the first year of the pledge, we committed to working toward:\n\nWe’re thrilled to report that all four of these commitments and more were met head on. (Please refer to the pledge for more details about each individual goal.)\n\nSome fun facts and figures from 2022 include:\n\nR.I.D.E. around accessibility in BRC was also a focus in 2022:\n\nNow some more specifics about the four “year one” commitments:\n\nGoal 1 — Normalizing work related to diversity, inclusivity, and anti-racism requires long-term multi-pronged efforts. Burning Man Project and the Burning Man community made substantial  strides over the past 18 months. A few of the changes implemented by Burning Man Project, and a sample of community initiatives are as follows\n\nGoal 2 — Burning Man would not be what it is without big (and small) art, and 2022 was a year of huge steps towards making the art and artists reflect the diversity of our community.\n\nGoal 3 — We highlighted stories and storytellers from BIPOC Burner communities and made them more accessible to the public through our various communications channels. Some examples:\n\nGoal 4 — During the 12 months between the pledge publishing and Burners’ arrival in the Black Rock Desert, many folks worked to build new pathways to expand BIPOC communities’ participation in BRC and beyond.\n\nThis team’s aim is to connect the dots of the R.I.D.E. work happening throughout the Burner ecosystem, and to work together in support of the community’s efforts related to belonging and justice. Reach out to connect and learn more about ways to get involved!\n\nLOOKING AHEAD TO BRC 2023 (AND BEYOND)\n\nAll of this is great, but we’re not stopping! The pledge outlines three-year goals, and some big ambitions (again, refer back to the pledge to learn more). We’ve already started up on some of those, and we’ll be sharing more soon. On our docket for this year already:\n\nThere is, of course, much more to be discovered, and the path will reveal itself organically as we move forward. We’re thrilled to be on this…ahem…ride with all of you, and we can’t wait to see what creativity, art, and magic is set forth this season. If you have any questions or would like to be more involved in Burning Man Project’s R.I.D.E. work, feel free to email diversity@burningman.org.",
