  "content": "You may already be familiar with Jason Silva from his appearance on the Burning Man LIVE podcast. Or from his tenure as host of National Geographic’s Brain Games. This amazing philosophical rant, The Human Condition, was recorded in Black Rock City 2019, and then enhanced via AI to add kaleidoscopic art visuals. The resulting video is thought-provoking and extraordinarily trippy – and a great way to kick off a season of thinking about the power of dreams to recreate our world.",
