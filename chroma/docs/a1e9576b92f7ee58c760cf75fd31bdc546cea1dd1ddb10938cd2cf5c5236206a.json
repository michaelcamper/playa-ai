  "content": "“An inverter hooked up to a truck/van/car is often plenty of power for most/many people.  And yet every year many people lug out expensive, noisy generators meant to produce way more power than they actually need.\n\nInverters come in a range of sizes (150 Watt to 1000 Watt) and when hooked up to a vehicle make a great impromptu generator.  The vehicle will have to be run occasionally to charge the battery but it will be much quieter and produce way fewer emissions than conventional generators.   Just don’t run out of gas on playa!\n\nUnless they’re running a large sound system or some other power hungry project most camps don’t need a generator. Modern automotive alternators are designed to produce 100+ amps of DC current which is more than enough to power a 400 Watt inverter.\n\nJust a thought.\n\nDC Chris”",
