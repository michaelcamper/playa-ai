  "content": "Word’s come back that folks don’t feel like there’s anyplace to list all the things that happened regarding the Green Man theme this year, so here’s a partial list–please email environment at burning man dot com with omissions, and we’ll add em in!\n\nPre-Event Staff Operations/Education:\n\nStaff field trip to Solar Living Institute\nOur first ever field trip, we took 25 staff to learn about solar power, permaculture, composting, etc.\n\nBrown bag lunch lecture series\nA total of five conversations held at the office, on a variety of environmental topics. The goal was to raise overall awareness while giving staff a common language for understanding some of the issues we’d be dealing with. The last of them, a debate between Jim Mason and Dr. David Shearer over carbon offsets, was attended by 40+ people.\n\nRecycle Your Life Day\nTwo week long in-office swaps of clothing, furniture etc. Kept items out of the landfill, and sent a lot of material to Goodwill.\n\nPre-Event Participant Education:\n\nGreen Working Group\nEstablished open forum for any participant to suggest changes, initiate projects, meeting every other week at the office. Produced dozens of ideas, large and small, that were acted on/implemented.\n\nGreen House\nWonderful event in conjunction with Open House/Volunteer Day. Sparked a lot of energy—almost like people looked around and said “wow, I had no idea there were so many people like me!” Dozens of displays, educational tools, workshops, fashion show, music–you name it, we had it going on.\n\nEnvironmental Section of Burningman.com\nBuilt extensive Environmental Section of the web site, chock full of great information.\n\nEnviroblog\nRanked as #3 overall most viewed page on Burning Man website. More than 70 posts covering a wide range of topics.\n\nGreen BRC Stickers\nAn inexpensive hack on the familiar black BRC ovals of years past, we gave out more that 5,000—amazing to see them proliferate.\n\nRevised questionnaires\nTheme Camp, Art, and DMV questionnaires revised to capture alt energy/environmental planning information.\n\nEvent-based education\n\nGreen Guide\nWe created a separate “Green Map and Guide,” an 11×17 two sided map and index of events, installations, and educational happenings.\n\nGreen Man Speaks\nA week-long series of conversations inspired by the Green Man theme, held at Otter Oasis.\n\nLarge Scale Art Camp Networking\nWe worked with LSSACs to connect them to vendors for access to biodiesel generators, and to network their power grids–reducing cost, reducing pollution, building awareness, and fostering community.\n\nEarth Rise Film Fest\nA first-time participant organized a film festival at Entheon Village. Over 200 films were to be screened throughout the event, included DiCaprio’s “11th Hour.”\n\nCIVIKS\nBuilt and installed four three sided kiosks to display civic information throughout the city, with a focus on the theme. They were built outside the ranger outposts, and in the 4:30/7:30 plaza. Lit by solar power, they provided 24-hour info and maps, as well as event listings and MOOP maps (another first).\n\nEvent Operations\n\nEnergy Use Analysis\nWorking with Jeff Cole at California Environmental Associates, we conducted our first-ever analysis of energy produced to energy used, and found we often times had three or four times more capacity than needed, which allowed us to better scale our generation and attendant fuel use/pollution.\n\nEnvironmental Assessment\nWorking with a team of volunteers, Dr. Elizabeth Dougherty (with California’s Flex Your Power office) is conducting a comprehensive baseline assessment of BM’s environmental efforts. They are analyzing purchasing, materials, processes, and transportation—pretty much every aspect of the event. Report due in January—will be unmatched look at how we’ve done, and where we can improve.\n\nCooling Man\nFor the first time, we calculated the entire carbon footprint of the event. To our knowledge, we are the only event in the world that has done this. Our total impact, adjusted upwards for increased participants, was 34,000 tons. Contributions and actions by participants offset 851 tons of that—almost quadruple what last year’s number.\n\nWood Recycling\nBWB/DPW collected a total of 56 units of lumber, up from 42 last year. This increase is especially noteworthy considering that ½ the lumber from 2006 was from the Belgian Waffle.\n\nAluminum, Glass, Etc Recycling\nOFFSITE: Albertson’s in Reno gifted seven drive through drop off recycling centers, and hang tags with maps to the locations, which were distributed via Recycle Camp and Playa Info. Some totals: Aluminum and tin – 600 lbs; Plastics — 48 watermelon bins full; Glass:14 bins; Cardboard — 35 pallets (much of which was taken from burners as they were shopping to go to BRC). The proceeds are being donated to the Gerlach school to cover maintenance on their solar array.\n\nONSITE: During the event, the commissary and the café both collected and sorted recycling. This was a big success—at times too much of one. The recycling at the café piled up and needed to be removed to the depot for staging, which didn’t happen as quickly or often as needed.\n\nComposting\nFirst ever attempt to segregate and process compost from the event. Resulted in four dumpsters of compost (two from commissary, one from café, one from participants).\nUnique partnership with the City of San Francisco provided 65 theme camps with green composting bins, which generated an entire 30 yard dumpster of compost. The SF Dept. of the Environment has called this “some of the best educational outreach money we’ve ever spent.”\n\nBiodiesel Shuttle Bus\nParticipant sponsored/operated shuttle ran from Reno Airport to playa, with a stop at Whole Foods. Worked well, most buses sold out, though not all seats were full.\n\nEvent Infrastructure\n\nLowered Power Use\nBy using all LED or compact fluorescent lighting, we were able to increase the size of the man base by a factor of ten, and still cut the power load by 50%.\n\nCafé\nThe crew here was green before green was cool, and still are. They composted and recycled (see elsewhere) and produced express lanes for those who brought their own cups.\n\nCommissary\nComposted and recycled (see elsewhere) and switched entirely to corn based utensils for to-go meals, without additional cost.\n\nGate/Plant Policy\nOn the fly, we devised a strategy that would keep plants out of the city…and out of the trash. Gate aggregated plants coming into the city, and every morning Joy would pick them up and bring them to the office in Gerlach, where they could be picked up of the porch by locals.\n\nBiodiesel\nWe stipulated in our RFP that we wanted to run all biodiesel in our generators, and were thus able to convert 87% of our load to renewable energy—and change the way vendors approach biodiesel use. Approximately 11,000 gallons of locally produced fuel were expected to be used. Additionally, over 50 camps were able to go biodiesel because we opened the door.\n\nSolar Array\nBuilt and operated at 30kW solar array and educational center, to power the man base and Green Man Pavilions, running the man base on 100% renewable energy.\n\nYellow Bikes program\nWe had the largest per capita community bike program of any city in the world; some 700 bikes were in use. Next year with more time ( we only had a month’s notice) we’ll have all 1200 bikes built, and their baskets ( with instructions, and lights!) installed.\n\nGreen Man Pavilion\nWe had 30+ installations covering a variety of environmental issues/solutions, ranging from home DIY crafty kitsch to mind-blowing innovation. Truly some world-class installations, and an incredible opportunity for us to expand the very nature of what we mean when we say “participant.”\n\nPost Event:\nBlack Rock Solar\nIn October, volunteers and staff will begin building 120kW of solar power to be donated to the town of Gerlach, and 60kW to the town of Lovelock. Over the next 20 years, these projects will net $2.5+million in free energy for those communities.\n\nNot too shabby, eh?",
