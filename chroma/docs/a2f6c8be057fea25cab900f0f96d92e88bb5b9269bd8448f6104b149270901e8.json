  "content": "Greetings MOOP maniacs and line sweepers extraordinaire! The Hun here, typing with gloves on. Yes, winter has socked the Playa Restoration All-Star team a good one these past few days, with temperatures in the 30s and rude winds poking icy fingers under our collars and down our backs. Just a week ago, we were basking in bikinis. Today, we’re wearing all the clothes we own.\n\nPlaya Restoration ends next Wednesday with the BLM site inspection. Between now and then, the Resto All-Stars are braving the wind and weather to pick up all the MOOP we can find and return the playa surface to a pristine state.\n\nChanges to the MOOP Map\n\nAs I’ve mentioned before, the MOOP Map you see on this blog is a record of our progress — but it’s a living document, not the final map. Once we record all the data, we cross-check it thoroughly and make changes where appropriate. Today’s map may look very slightly different, so have another look at your spot!\n\nAn Open Letter to Black Rock City about the MOOP Map\n\nFrom D.A., Playa Restoration Manager:\n\nAnd now, the MOOP Map\n\nWithout any further ado, here is your MOOP Map, Day 5.\n\nREMEMBER: This is a work in progress, not the final map. Obviously.\n\nWith just a few outer streets remaining, Black Rock City is looking FANTASTIC. Great job, everyone!\n\nTune in again soon to find out how the outer streets and open playa are looking! It’s all coming up in future installments of MOOP Map Live 2013.\n\nSee more photos from Playa Restoration 2013 on Flickr.",
