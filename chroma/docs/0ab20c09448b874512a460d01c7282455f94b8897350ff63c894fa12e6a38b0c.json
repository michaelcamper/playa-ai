  "content": "This year, the Virtual Burn was a two-week extravaganza — an award-winning technological Tour de Force — that participants absolutely loved and many say should be a direction that Burning Man goes in from now on.\n\nThis year, Plan B’s “Renegade Burn” took place out on the Black Rock Desert and — despite fairly stringent requirements from the Bureau of Land Management — created a magical week that participants absolutely loved and that many say should be the direction that Burning Man goes in from now on.\n\nThis year, Regional groups and small art groups and people like me decided not to go anywhere, but to “do Burning Man” right where we live, creating art experiences in ordinary environments. We absolutely loved it, and many say that paying less attention to the desert and huge events in order to Burn where you are is the direction that Burning Man should go in from now on.\n\nSo this is what Burning Man’s doing next, because it’s what Burners want. Got it?\n\nThis is a new phase of Burning Man’s cultural development, now entering into — by my calculations — its third year.\n\nDude, Where’s My Culture?\n\nBack in 2016, I proposed that Burning Man had gone through four distinct cultural phases. Danger Ranger said it was five. One of us could be right and the other could be wrong, but I think it’s more likely that Burning Man culture is a paradox and whether you saw four or five phases depended on whether you were moving at the speed of light and if your cat was dead.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Burning Man entered a new cultural phase — though we’re only beginning to acknowledge it now because we spent so long hoping that things would get “back to normal.” But even if the pandemic subsided, they wouldn’t have. They certainly won’t now.\n\nTo understand this fifth phase (or sixth, if Danger Ranger’s theme camp crosses the event horizon of a black hole), let me quickly run through the other four. I won’t take long, and I think this progression matters. Here we go:\n\nFirst, Burning Man was an experiment: it was some people on a beach going, “Hey, what happens if we burn a life-sized wooden man? Let’s find out!”\n\nSecond, Burning Man was a frontier: people were going out to a strange and desolate environment where there was no existing settlement, and building one. Burning Man for most of this period was synonymous with “Black Rock City,” because what else was Burning Man but going to this desolate frontier and building a temporary settlement together?\n\nAs the Regionals developed, Burning Man entered its third phase, becoming a culture: it now existed independently of its traditional location in space. It had an ethos — the 10 Principles — it had traditions, and it became something you could do anywhere. It was no longer “we go to this place,” but instead became “these are the things that we value and do.”\n\nAs Burning Man became a truly global community, it entered into its High Culture phase, in which you had increasing collaboration between cross-cultural and transnational groups who were trying to engage in truly enormous projects and solve wicked social problems … all of which requires a level of standardization and bureaucracy to do properly. And so a kind of large-scale — though often informal — administrative state emerged even as Burning Man became more diverse, because more people from more places were trying to do bigger and bigger things together. High Cultures are more diverse in many ways, but also less diverse in others because, past a certain point, collaboration means standardization and bureaucratization. Otherwise you have to reinvent the wheel every time.\n\nIn all these phases, Burning Man had either a location where “it” happened (Baker Beach, the playa), or cultural centers around which the axis of its global culture spun (the playa, but even more so San Francisco and Reno, where the administrative offices are).\n\nThe pandemic changed all of that. To extend a metaphor: our culture’s capital city was gone. Further, all of our Regional capitals, where major Regional Events happened, were gone. All of our cultural centers — abruptly gone.\n\nThe administrative centers remained … but what was there to administer?\n\nThe literal answer to that question is: lots of stuff. It was, in fact, an administrative crisis, and preserving much of what had been done for the future was a significant challenge.\n\nBut the figurative answer from the standpoint of a living culture was … unclear. Years before the pandemic, Burning Man Project had hoped, over time, to transition to a state in which its non-profit elements and programs for cultural development would have been robust and significant enough to exist on their own, but it hadn’t gotten there yet. The Project had been the center of the Burning Man world because it had run The Big Burn and liaised with the Regional Burns … but without those, its relevance to the daily lives of most Burners was a giant question mark.\n\nThus Burning Man culture entered its new cultural phase: Diaspora. A culture scattered to the winds, without a center. Without a home to be welcomed to.\n\nWhat Do We Want? Everything!\n\nCultures in diaspora may long for their historical and mythical homelands, but they are more directly influenced by their neighbors — by the places they actually are and what is immediately happening around them. Lacking a common center of gravity, they tend to diversify, going in multiple — even contradictory — directions at once. Which is what we see happening now with Burning Man.\n\nSome Burners want a return to the full cultural scaffolding, painstakingly and collaboratively built over decades, because it helped them do big things that they were passionate about. It isn’t a sacrifice for them — it’s an opportunity. Other Burners are thrilled by the prospect of getting to spend more time in a frontier, because frontiers can be incredibly fun and challenging. Some want to lay claim to Burning Man being a specific place again, the Black Rock Desert. Others say the deserts of Spain and the Middle East and the lakes of the Midwest and the street corners of the Southeast are as important to Burning Man as the playa in Nevada.\n\nThe point isn’t that anyone is right or wrong: the point is that it’s all true at the same time. The center has not held, and so there are no central organizing elements with the same moral authority and cultural gravity that we used to have. Which means we’re all a more localized, fragmented, community than we have ever been before. Our passions have no common container to hold them.\n\nWhether or not this is a good thing depends on how we respond to it.\n\nArguing About Fun Is Less Fun Than Doing Things\n\nThis will be a terrible time in Burner culture if we start fighting about the “one true way to Burn” — if the people who love VR can’t imagine why someone would want to go camping without roads, and the Plan B Burners say that because they had a great time no one gets to have roads again, and San Franciscans and Angelino Burners really rip into each other about how to make the best burrito … that kind of schism reduces us all.\n\nBurning Man culture doesn’t thrive in those kinds of arguments because Burning Man culture is about discovering and supporting one another’s passions — about having so much fun that complete strangers want to join you — rather than shutting down other people’s passions and fun.\n\nOne of the things that Burning Man has had in common in all of its cultural phases was that it helped people find what they really wanted to do when the bullshit and the empty gestures of society were taken away, and then encouraged and supported them in doing just that. As I’ve written elsewhere: there is perhaps no more perfect distillation of Burning Man culture than to see someone doing something weird and amazing that you don’t understand, and asking them, “Can I help?”\n\nBecause the more support they get, the better at it they’re going to become, until eventually they’ll offer us experiences we never imagined that will blow our minds.\n\n“You’re doing it wrong!” was a wonderfully funny thing to shout at each other when we all had a common center. Now, at the risk of being earnest, I think “what have you learned?” is a better thing to ask one another from our separate corners of this Burning world.\n\nSo, How Does This End?\n\nThe diaspora is going to get weird for a while. As we pack the 10 Principles on our backs and head in different directions, looking more to the people around us than the former center of our world, we are likely to become increasingly unrecognizable to ourselves.\n\nThe Diaspora period will end when some group or groups get(s) enough moral and cultural authority that people willingly orient themselves to what they’re doing.\n\nAnd how do they do that? The way it’s always happened in Burning Man culture: by helping other people have their own fun and meaningful experiences. Not by telling them “you need to do what I want to do,” but by helping them do what they want to do — and doing it in such a fun and meaningful way that they decide on their own that they want what you do to be part of their lives.",
