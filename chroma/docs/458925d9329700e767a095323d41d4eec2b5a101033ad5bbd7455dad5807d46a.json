  "content": "We’re the Census Lab volunteers, a motley team of information geeks, academic researchers, students, and general data nerds who have surveyed Black Rock City (BRC) residents since 2002. Armed with lab coats and hot pink gear, we survey randomly selected cars of Burners arriving at the BRC gate. Then, when everyone gets home, we ask all BRC citizens to answer questions about their lives and likes to describe who they are, where they come from, and how they experience Burning Man. These data are published in our Afterburn Report and other reports (see the AfterBurn Report on Burning Man 2015) and are available to the community, the Burning Man Project, and numerous other stakeholders.\n\nIn the past, we’ve reported our findings on our own blog, but now we’re going to come straight to you, right here in the Burning Man Journal. By way of introducing ourselves, we’d like to answer a few FAQs we receive from Burners every year.\n\nWhat the heck is the Census?\n\nThe Census used to be a big paper survey that Burners filled out on-playa at the Census Lab. In the last few years, we have changed our methods in an effort to collect more accurate data about the people in BRC. Now, we collect demographic data from a random selection of Burners entering BRC, then use that information to make our post-event survey results even more statistically representative.\n\nAfter the event, we invite all Burners to complete the survey. We ask Burners questions about the number of Burns they’ve attended, their socio-demographic characteristics, what they do in Nevada, how they arrive on playa, how they camp on playa, and their personal identities. Since 2014, the Census also collects free-form responses from field notes journals spread throughout various locations in BRC. Each journal contains a short set of open­-ended questions about a particular topic. We’ll explain a bit more about field notes later on in this post.\n\nAlthough the BRC Census is technically a survey and not a census, we provide the most statistically reliable and valid estimates concerning the BRC population. This is the fourth consecutive year using our sampling and weighting methods.\n\nThe Census is an independent research collaboration between the Census Lab and the Burning Man Project. The Census obtained Institutional Review Board (a committee on research ethics) approval from Denver University and no personal identifying information is collected so that respondent confidentiality is protected.\n\nWait, how can you accurately describe all Burners with a survey that only some Burners complete? (A.K.A. Weighting the Census)\n\nEven though only a portion of all Burners complete the online Census, we can statistically analyze these results and produce results that describe the whole BRC population. To do this, we create an unbiased reference by randomly sampling Burners coming into BRC at different points and times (cars at the gate during pre-event arrival, ingress, Burner Express riders, and soon even BRC Airport arrivals). We ask approximately nine sociodemographic questions to the randomly selected Burners who agree to participate. Using these unbiased reference variables, we correct (i.e., weight) the online responses so they are representative of the total population of Burning Man attendees that year.\n\nIn other words, the weighting procedure corrects biases due to self-selection in the online survey (or the phenomenon where Burners who decide to fill out the Census might be different from those who decide not to fill it out). Thus, the online Census results are weighted according to this random sampling, improving the collective accuracy of the data.\n\nThough these results are the most reliable estimates that we have of the BRC population, the true population values could differ slightly from the presented values due to measurement error (sometimes referred to as margin of error). These measurement errors, however, are very small due to the sheer number of survey participants. More precisely, the margin of error for most estimated proportions is roughly 1% or less (for all of you statistics enthusiasts, we’ll release another post specifying BRC Census methodology in the coming weeks).\n\nOkay, but why do you collect these data to begin with?\n\nWe use Census data in three main ways:\n\nCool! What kinds of questions can you answer using the Census data?\n\nLots of things, many of which are covered in the 2015 AfterBurn Report. Some examples could include:\n\nStay tuned and we’ll be answering some of the following questions in future blog posts:\n\nWe also provide the Burning Man Project with various information to help them plan and manage the event. For example, we estimate the proportion of carpooling Burners, radio ratings for BMIR, and Burners’ fuel consumption.\n\nYou mentioned the field notes. What is that, and how is it different from the online questionnaire?\n\nField notes are a pen-and-paper-based interactive component of the Census. Available only on playa, field notes are large notebooks placed in different locations throughout BRC. While we ask respondents particular questions about the experience of Burning Man and their reactions to the particular location of the notebook (i.e. Temple versus Census Lab), responses can be verbal or visual with some Burners providing illustrations or emotive journal-style entries.\n\nIn 2015, we asked questions such as:\n\nI’m intrigued. How can I learn more about the Census or about the population of Burners?\n\nFor more results, visit us on the playa near Center Camp, at our archival blog, or, starting with the 2015 Census, at our new Burning Man Journal page. We’ll be posting to this site every week or so, and we look forward to sharing the data nerdiness with you!\n\nWhat about volunteering for the Census?\n\nWe’re glad you asked! We love our volunteers and would love to have you on the team. More than 150 volunteers were involved with the Census Lab this year and we are always fond of having fresh faces on the team. Just go to our Volunteer Resources Page for more information on getting involved.\n\nWritten by Rebecca Mason (B^2), edited by Dominic Beaulieu-Prévost (Hunter), Dana Lilienthal DeVaul (DV8), and Rachel McKay\n\nTop photo by Philippe Glade",
