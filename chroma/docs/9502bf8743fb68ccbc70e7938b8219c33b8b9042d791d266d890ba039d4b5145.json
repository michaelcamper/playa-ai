There are hundreds…no, clearly thousands of auto headlamps visible on Gate Road, something that Danger Ranger once referred to as the “String of Pearls”. Swarms of clean people are pouring out of the radial streets onto the iinner playa…and I just saw one guy belly flop with joy into the dust. And the art. The art is up, and more is coming. I can’t see it all. I can’t shoot it all. I can barely even decide which of the 3000 images I’ve captured in the last few days to display here.\n\nSo, without further ado, here’s a small sample of what Burning Man 2011 has in store for you.\n\n“Orgasm” by Brian Tedrick\n\n“Ouroboros” by the Flipside CORE project\n\nGiant VW Bus (who are these guys? I didn’t get their names!)\n\nMarco Cochrane’s “Beauty Is Truth” and the Temple of Transition at sunset\n\nThe Temple of Transition during a blood-red sunrise. The crew was in top form on their final workday before opening to the public….and the sunrise was spectacular.\n\nThere are a bunch more on my flickr page here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelholden. Leave a comment if you’ve got any questions. And on that note I’m going to go out and see some art, talk with some folks and probably take about a thousand photos. With any luck I’ll make it back to Center Camp before sunrise and post a few of them. If not it’s because I’ve been taken in by a bunch of drag nuns who are feeding me salmon and mimosas out at the trash fence. Or something like that. More soon, I promise.",
