A superior form of Gaia in Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, Galaxia is the ultimate network, the fabric of the universe connecting living beings into one entity.\n\nGalaxia is shaped of 20 timber trusses converging as a spiral towards one point in the sky. The triangular trusses form different paths towards a central space holding a giant 3D printed mandala, the heart of Galaxia. The timber modules start large enough to hold small alcoves in which people can write in peace. As participants walk through the path, the timber modules lift up and become thinner and thinner towards the sky as people reach the central mandala.\n\nThe Artists\n\nArthur Mamou-Mani is a London-based French architect and director of Mamou-Mani Architects, which specializes in a new kind of digitally designed and fabricated architecture. He is a professor at the University of Westminster and owns a digital fabrication laboratory called the Fab.Pub.\n\nFor the past six years, he and his Masters of Architecture students at the University of Westminster in London’s WeWantToLearn studio (with Toby Burgess) have been bringing art installations to Black Rock City: Shipwreck, Fractal Cult, Hayam Sun Temple, The Infinity Tree, Reflections, Bismuth Bivouac, and Tangential Dreams, which won the prestigious Architizer A+ Award in architecture in 2016.\n\nArthur is an advocate for a new approach to architecture in which the architect is also the maker. Sounds like a perfect fit for Burning Man, right? His work matches 3D modeling tools like Rhinoceros and Grasshopper 3D with fabrication tools like laser cutters and 3D printers. By encouraging his students to design and build art installations at Burning Man, they are able to receive on-site mentorship and unique hands-on building experience that isn’t available in a university context.\n\nThis relationship between Westminster and Burning Man speaks to the growing relationships we are building worldwide with schools of architecture and urban planners. Black Rock City is, in fact, a city — a place where we create spaces for human experiences and provide opportunities for learning. We’re also excited to have an international Temple as a reflection of the increasingly global nature of our community.\n\nHow You Can Get Involved\n\nBuilding the Black Rock City Temple is a significant undertaking. It’s also a chance to realize a dream and create a space for thousands of participants to have meaningful experiences.\n\nInterested in joining the Temple Crew? While Arthur and his team already have some roles filled, they will be looking to the community to help bring the Temple to life. The build is planned to take place primarily in Reno, and interested folks from other locations can get involved, too. We expect a call for volunteers to come sometime in the spring.\n\nBuilding the Temple is a big financial commitment, and the grant covers a portion of the total expenses. If you’re looking to make a year-end tax deductible donation, we’re pleased to share that Burning Man Project is fiscally sponsoring this year’s Temple project.
