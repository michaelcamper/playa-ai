  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is back with a second season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS02 E09 – Fuck You & Your Hug\n\nFriend-of-the-Show Xeno moderates a roundtable of DPW hardcases: Monk, Gage, and Frisky Whisky (from S02 E07.) Monk has opinions about voluntourism, worker’s rights, and penetrations. Gage finds his way through the red tape, while Frisky Whisky discovers what’s in the bucket. Friend-of-the-Show Xeno shares his management philosophy and the transgressive chicanery he got into at Flipside. There’s the first installment of the Accuracy Third Glossary segment, and pretty much everybody has multitool on them. Find out about the awful shit we drank, and if you want t-shirts, I guess we’ll design and print them.\n\nS02 E10 – Participation as Indoctrination: Stories from GLC 2017\n\nBeth & Rex “twinkle that yo” at the Burning Man Global Leadership Conference, which is as familiarly corporate as any conference you’ve seen. But our people dress better, and our hair is as awesome as our tattoos are bad. We talk about several regionals, Kostume Kult, and how we’re doing it wrong. A safety plan for tornadoes. D-Day already knows about permaculture. When to say yes. Blazing Swan is not a bush doof, and Beth exhibits impeccable consent with a previous guest.\n\nAccuracy Third needs your help! If you like what we’re doing, please subscribe to our podcast and rate us in iTunes, the Google Play store, or Stitcher. Help us tell their algorithms to smush our voices into as many ears as possible. Together, we can tell the world what we’re doing at that thing in the desert!",
