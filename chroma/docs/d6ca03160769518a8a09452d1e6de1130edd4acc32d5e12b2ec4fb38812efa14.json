  "content": "We hope you are safe and healthy in these uncertain times. The fact is that everything has changed. The existential commitments that define us — to family, friends, career, creative expression, research, play, and exploration — have suddenly been jumbled together, competing for our time in ways that blur together the hours, days, and weeks.\n\nThere remains much uncertainty as to what the next few months will bring. While for some, sheltering in place means more time for creativity, for many others it means struggles in the wake of losing a job, increased workload, constant childcare, or life-changing illness. For team members taking part in Land Art Generator Initiative (LAGI) 2020 Fly Ranch, collaborations have become difficult as physical distancing remains one of the few tools we have on hand to fight the spread of the virus.\n\nWe have therefore made the decision to extend the submission deadline for LAGI 2020 Fly Ranch by five months to October 31, 2020.\n\nThe selection process will begin in November 2020 and selected teams will be notified in February 2021. Prototype development and installation will still take place as previously scheduled in the spring and summer of 2021.\n\nIf you were on target to submit your design before the original May 31 deadline, we ask for your understanding and hope that you will see this extension as an opportunity. You are still welcome to upload your submission by May 31. You can have the comfort of knowing that you are free to go back and swap out any files you upload to the web application between May 31 and October 31 if you decide you would like to change your submission during that time.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for bringing your ideas to LAGI 2020 Fly Ranch and to the world. We hope that this design challenge can provide a healing creative outlet for many, a learning experience for others.\n\nAs Arundhati Roy remarked this past week, “Historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next.”\n\nWe hope you will be inclined to use the LAGI 2020 Fly Ranch design challenge to create what you see on the other side of the portal. We’re wishing you health and safety in this unsure time.\n\nAs always, you can find more info at https://lagi2020flyranch.org/.
