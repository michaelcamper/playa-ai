  "content": "The upstanding citizens over at the Accuracy Third podcast have done a couple special episodes on topics that matter a lot, whether you’re out in the desert or not.\n\nOne is consent, which our culture (and all cultures) must study, practice, and shout from the rooftops, and we pencil-pushers at Burning Man Project have also published some new resources about it recently. The other is hygiene, which is, of course, also good. You might have some long drives coming up soon for which you are in need of listening materials, so here you go.\n\nFuck Yes! Consent Culture in Black Rock\n\nWhat can a consent talk do? Do better at that. Consent is counter to western culture. Express yourself. Cultural Scripts. More thoughtful. There are Rangers and ESDs. Hurt feelings. STDs. Expectations. The Dick Squeeze. The mental health area. Talking photos. Rejection v. Enthusiastic Consent vs. Acquiescing. Questions are everything. Check out: 11th Principle: Consent! and the Bureau of Erotic Discourse (B.E.D.). Music by: Coywolf\n\nWhen Is It Time to Brush Your Teeth? Hygiene for Action Hippies\n\nQueen Dee talkin’ ’bout feet! Buttercup tells us about personal and camp hygiene. Poni implored you to get a diva cup. Dandy & Pops discuss wet wipin’. Hand and foot ceviche. Crocs & socks (on playa.) Poni’s teeth smell delicious. Rex keeps talking about his socks. Hot Fuzz has a mindful time on playa. Never hear about hygiene again. Coconut oil scuba diving. Armpits, asshole, crotch, and teeth. Beth’s feet are jocks. D-day recognizes his limitations. Also, it’s Monistat, not Vagisil. #RealFierce #FierceLife #OlivePower #Curls4Days\n\nThe Accuracy Third folks write:\n\n“Accuracy Third needs your help! If you like what we’re doing, please subscribe to our podcast and rate us in iTunes, the Google Play store, or Stitcher. Help us tell their algorithms to smush our voices into as many ears as possible. Together, we can tell the world what we’re doing at that thing in the desert!”",
