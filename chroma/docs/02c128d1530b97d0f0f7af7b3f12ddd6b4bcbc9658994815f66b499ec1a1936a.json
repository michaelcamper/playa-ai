  "content": "Hello out there, MOOP maniacs! Today, we’re giving the intrepid Playa Restoration team a little respite from their work restoring the Black Rock Desert. Instead, let’s turn our attention to another group that goes above and beyond the call of duty to make Burning Man an amazing experience: mutant vehicle owners.\n\nBlack Rock City wouldn’t be the same without mutant vehicle owners. They pour immeasurable amounts of their own time, money and artistic effort into the conveyances that cart you across the playa at a cool 5mph, day and night.\n\nBut mutant vehicles have their own challenges, one of which is MOOP. We’ve all seen a sound vehicle parked somewhere on the playa, creating an impromptu dance party that draws anywhere from ten to a thousand people. What happens when those people — and the vehicle — depart? In many cases, there’s a bit of MOOP left behind.\n\nIn fact, this year Playa Restoration discovered the remnants of just such a party in the outer playa off of L and 10:00 (GPS coordinates: 40.801, -119.206). They picked up over a hundred cigarette butts, along with broken jewelry and disco-ball mirrors. That spot yielded about a gallon of MOOP. How did it get there? Nobody knows, but odds are good there was a little dancing going on.\n\nIt’s not the vehicle driver’s responsibility to control their followers’ MOOP, but it is something we can all work on as a community. If we don’t, party spots like that could cause Burning Man to fail its BLM inspection.\n\nSo mutant vehicles and those who love ’em, chime in! What can vehicles do to combat MOOP? How can roving parties Leave No Trace?\n\nOne of the best ideas we’ve heard, submitted by The Glam King:\n\nGreat idea, and thanks to that DJ for taking the initiative. What other tactics do mutant vehicles use to prevent MOOP, and what are some new ideas they can try? Leave your comments below, please.",
