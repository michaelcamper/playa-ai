  "content": "FIGMENT is a forum for the creation and display of participatory and interactive art by emerging artists across disciplines. FIGMENT began in July 2007 as a free, one-day participatory arts event on Governors Island in New York Harbor with over 2,600 participants. Since then, FIGMENT has grown significantly each year—in number of projects, duration, participants, volunteers, fundraising capability, exhibitions, locations, overall level of commitment and participation, and public support. FIGMENT now expands to the Boston area, with its first event outside of New York and is one of the 2010 [BRAF]’s grant recipients!\n\nFIGMENT will be produced through a partnership with the Cambridge Arts Council, on June 5, 2010, co-located with the Cambridge Arts Council’s long-running Cambridge River Festival, on Memorial Drive on Saturday, June 5, 2010 from 12 pm to 6 pm.\n\nSee the web site for directions: figmentboston.org",
