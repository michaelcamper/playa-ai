  "content": "Hello sports fans, MOOP maniacs and line sweepers extraordinaire! The Hun here, reporting from Gerlach where things are starting to get VERY exciting for the DPW Playa Restoration team.\n\nOn Day Three of Line Sweeps, your Black Rock City home team swept through the remainder of the back blocks, then made a daring rush up the 10:00 edge and onto the Esplanade. Now in peak condition and thoroughly trained for the task, our Restoration MOOPers were eager to tackle the double-wide blocks of Esplanade and Anniversary, the very center of Burning Man’s epic antics.\n\nWhat will our brave Restoration team find on 10:00 and Esplanade? Will those heavily-trafficked blocks be Go-Go-Go Green, or Full Stop Red? Read on to find out…\n\nWow folks, that’s what you call a mixed bag. DA, Playa Restoration manager, had this to say:\n\nWondering what we found in those red zones? Our Special Forces report the following:\n\n8:30 & Esplanade: Wood debris and particle board, confetti, plastic debris and metal hardware.\n8:00 & Esplanade: An apparently small-ish pile of wood chips which had unfortunately been dragged all over the block. A clear case of “never let it hit the ground.”\n7:40 & Esplanade: A huge amount of wood chips, apparently from disintegrated OSB, that had blown throughout a large area.\n7:20 & Esplanade: Wood debris, pneumatic staples, metal hardware… and crawfish legs and shells.\n\nWhat was in the BLACK spot? Oh… EVERYTHING.\n\nYes, that’s some rough stuff folks — but look at all those green blocks! Considering how many people (and crawfish) the Esplanade camps served, they left a pretty clean playing field for our Restoration team.\n\nThe overall score for Day 3: 68% green, 24% yellow, 5% red and 3% BLACK.\n\nGot something to say about theme camps and MOOP? Weigh in here:\n\nTheme Camps, Big Messes and the Dirty Thirty\n\nAlso next week, I’ll be reporting on the toughest day our team has faced yet. Tune in soon for tales of woe, strife and tiny biting flies! ‘Til then, this is The Hun signing off.",
