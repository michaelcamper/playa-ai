  "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nSan Francisco, California – April 1, 2014 (Burning Man) – The Burning Man Project today announced the music lineup for the 2014 Burning Man festival.\n\n“We’re very excited about this year’s music lineup.” said Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, Burning Man’s musical talent coordinator.  “2014 is one of the most ambitious lineups in our history, and puts Burning Man squarely in the ranks of other popular Summer music festivals such as Coachella, Bonaroo, Glastonbury and the US Festival.”\n\nThe Burning Man festival will showcase five concert venues of varying sizes spread throughout the event.  Two venues will be reserved for smaller performances, two for medium sized performances, and one main venue will be placed just outside the man at the six o’clock road.  “We expect the Denial and Anger stages to be more intimate, and have located those within the city close to the three o’clock and nine o’clock plazas.  The Bargaining and Depression stages will be located on the open playa near the two o’clock road and the ten o’clock road.”\n\nKübler-Ross notes that the main venue, the Acceptance stage, is large enough to support a full production truss, with professional lighting and sound.  “The audience grandstands will face the Man,” said Kübler-Ross. “We plan to disassemble the Acceptance stage itself after the Friday night performance to make room for the crowds to gather for the main burn.”  Kübler-Ross also noted that the grandstands themselves would stay in place and serve as VIP seating for the burning of the man.\n\n“Our five stages have something for everyone,” said Kübler-Ross.  “We expect that, as people attend the festival for the week they’ll gradually move through all the stages before finally attending the last performance on the Acceptance stage Friday night.  It is a very natural progression.  We understand that some people may prefer to stay at a particular stage longer, but expect everyone to experience all five stages before the end.”\n\n“Some of our performers were very difficult to get,” added Kübler-Ross, “This year’s Burning Man event marks Keith Moon’s first public performance since he was invited to perform at the 2012 Olympic closing ceremonies in London, England.”  Keith Moon, the former drummer for The Who, was unable to appear at the 2012 Olympic closing ceremony due to issues with his availability.  Other artists on Burning Man’s 2014 roster are Jam Master Jay, Warren Zevon and Dave Brockie of GWAR.  “Dave Brockie only recently became available,” added Kübler-Ross.\n\nThe Burning Man event takes place on a dry lakebed in the Black Rock Desert north of Reno, Nevada between August 25th and Monday, September 1st, 2014.  For ticket or other scheduling information, visit the Burning Man website at http://www.burningman.com.\n\nDownload a PDF of this release, and the concert schedule, here:  Press Release – Concert Lineup\n\n# # #\n\nBurning Man 2014 Musical Performer Lineup\n\nDenial Stage:\n\nMonday, August 25, 2014:\n\nWednesday, August 27, 2014:\n\nAnger Stage:\n\nTuesday, August 26, 2014:\n\nThursday, August 28, 2014:\n\nBargaining Stage:\n\nMonday, August 25, 2014:\n\nWednesday, August 27, 2014:\n\nDepression Stage:\n\nTuesday, August 26, 2014:\n\nThursday, August 28, 2014:\n\nAcceptance Stage:\n\nMonday, August 25, 2014:\n\nTuesday, August 26, 2014:\n\nWednesday, August 27, 2014:\n\nThursday, August 28, 2014:\n\nFriday, August 29, 2014:\n\n*** All appearances are tentative.  Appearances may be cancelled at the sole discretion of the event organizers due to, among other reasons, performer availability or death.",
