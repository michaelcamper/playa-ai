  "content": "It’s a wrap! The 2014 Burning Man Global Leadership Conference was a heck of a party, but it was also a great meeting of minds. It was a chance for the far-flung leaders of Burning Man regional culture to learn from each other, and that includes the San Francisco Regional, sometimes known as Burning Man HQ. After all these groups compared notes at GLC, there could no longer be any doubt: Burning Man happens everywhere, all the time. The one week in Nevada is just for practice.\n\nWe had people on the ground tweeting and blogging about the conference and the sessions that seemed of interest to the wider world. Here’s a round-up of the major messages, so you can share in the learning, and some photos of the beautiful people.\n\nHere on the Burning Blog, a few of us covered the major sessions, as well as the delights and surprises we found in smaller sessions and just wandering around the place. Some of the lessons meditated upon in these posts: Burning Man’s properties emerged from chaos into beautiful order. Any city can produce the kinds of wonder, beauty, and community we get on the playa. The pressures of the global economy are making Burner values seem like an even better idea. Regional Burns are getting pretty epic; one of them is the size of Burning Man the year after the Wired Magazine cover. And the Burning Man founders and staff have come to see their role as “servant leadership,” supporting the rest of us doing our various things out in the world. Check out the blog posts to dive deeper.\n\nOut on The Twitter, the #bmglc14 hashtag is full of text and photo observations of the GLC and its people, so it’s fun to scroll through. Here’s one of the most popular tweets from the weekend:\n\nIf you wrote, photographed, filmed, or recorded anything about this year’s GLC, drop it in the comments, and we’ll embed it in this post, too.\n\nTo close us out, here are some photos of the GLC loveliness by Vertumnus:",
