  "content": "TL;DR\n\nBlack Rock citizens — participants as well as members of the Playa Restoration crew — faced new Leave No Trace (LNT) challenges caused by embedded Matter Out of Place (MOOP) and miles of hardened mud ruts following the exceptional weather in 2023. And we did it! Although close, Black Rock City passed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Post-Event Site Inspection AND reduced the total MOOP average by 25% compared to 2022. Eleven out of the 120 BLM test points exceeded the 1 sq.ft./acre average — all in the City Grid. This year we saw another rise in the lag bolt/tent stake/rebar category, making it once again the #1 Worst MOOP. Resto also documented a significant increase in wood, cardboard, and plastic MOOP due to complications associated with traversing the mud. The success of LNT depends on the community! Resto exists to work with you, NOT to do it for you!\n\nA Wet and Wild Come-from-behind Victory\n\nAfter a wet and wild Burning Man event, Black Rock City citizens put in a solid leave no trace effort under extraordinary conditions. Then the Playa Restoration All-star Team followed up these efforts with a tremendous amount of heart. The result? We did better than just ‘barely passing the BLM Post-Event Inspection’, as had been reported. Facing unprecedented challenges in the dried-up mud, our communal effort brought the total average amount of MOOP down 25% compared to 2022, as reported by the BLM.\n\nHowever, 11 test points out of 120 did exceed the one square foot per acre standard, bringing us to the 10% allowable amount implemented by the BLM in 2019.\n\nThat isn’t to say that this victory was easy. Hell no. Participants were advised against driving in the mud because vehicles can get stuck. But also, driving in playa mud creates deep ruts that later dry and harden like concrete. Remediating the ruts and their effects on MOOP was one of the most complex Leave No Trace challenges we’ve ever faced.\n\nBurning Man 2023, Before the Storm\n\nRemember the event before the storm hit? We experienced no wind, no punishing dust storms, and no MOOP blowing out to the perimeter/trash fence. Burning Man 2023 was beautiful and on track to be one of the cleanest ever.\n\nYou know what happened next. It poured. Some people grabbed what they could and struggled against the mud to get off the playa. Some made it off. Others got stuck. Many left the detritus of their escape attempts — wood, cardboard, carpet — behind in the mud, which then dried.\n\nBut that was the exception. Most of you stayed, had your Burn, let the mud dry, cleaned up your camps and projects, and drove off the playa.\n\nGiven these challenges, yet knowing that the Black Rock City community is generally good at cleaning up, and knowing that the event was clean before the storm, Resto had a fighting chance at following up the community’s heroic efforts against the unknown terrain of hardened mud ruts and potential MOOP, big and small.\n\nResto Trash Train Takes a First Pass to Pick up Big MOOP\n\nDespite what things may have looked like during Exodus, most items that initially appeared to be abandoned — infrastructure, trash, and vehicles — were picked up by the owners. As the last participants left the playa, we received encouraging intel from the Resto Trash Train Coordinator, Lexington: the number of large abandoned items was not as high as feared — only about 4½ 40-yard dumpsters — close to the same volume as in 2022, and similar to previous years. For a peak population of 74,126 this was not bad. This was the first sign of hopeful news.\n\nResto Highway Cleanup Tackles Road Debris\n\nMeanwhile, Highway Cleanup was on the road, documenting and picking up road debris that typically flies off of vehicles during Exodus. Again, hopeful news was reported, this time from Highway Cleanup Manager, Barbarella. The highways were looking even better than in previous years.\n\nPlaya Restoration All-Star Team Assembles for MOOP Sweeps\n\nWith good news from the pre-Resto operations, we would soon reach the moment of truth with the Playa Restoration All-Star Team assembling to follow up Black Rock citizens’ Leave No Trace effort.\n\nThe 150-person Resto team represented not only the best of the Black Rock City Department of Public Works (DPW), but also stellar participants from many departments, theme camps, art projects, Regional Events, and the worldwide community. We needed all the good help that we could sustain to MOOP sweep the more than 3,600 acres, or approximately 157 million square feet, of BRC.\n\nAs soon as Resto hit the playa, it was clear that some camps were immaculate, while others struggled to clean up. Sometimes those camps were right next to each other. The areas that were clean were fairly clean, but the areas that were MOOPy were very MOOPy. The time-consuming challenge of 2023 would involve prying embedded MOOP from the playa surface and navigating the irregular terrain.\n\nBased on Resto’s data, the volume of MOOP in all debris categories — such as  lag bolts/stakes/rebar, plastic debris, cardboard debris and wood debris — went up. Resto hustled to scour BRC multiple times, ultimately picking up the most MOOP ever and filling the dumpster to the limit.\n\nOperation Playa Zamboni vs. the Mud Ruts\n\nWhile peeling up embedded MOOP from the playa surface was challenging, there was a new complication: the miles of dried mud ruts funneling through the city streets, down through Gate Road, out to the 8 Mile and 12 Mile exits, and everywhere in between. In accordance with our Leaving No Trace principle, we made it our highest priority to flatten the playa back to its natural state.\n\n“Operation Playa Zamboni” was born. Using a box grader, a compression roller and water truck, we leveled the surface, compressed the soil until it was hard-packed, and then reset it with water. Resto MOOP sweeps were already moving through BRC; we therefore needed careful coordination: MOOP sweeps first, then Operation Playa Zamboni, and then a second MOOP sweep. Amazingly, it went like clockwork and none too soon. The inspection was coming up quickly.\n\nBLM Post-Event Site Inspection\n\nOn Wednesday, October 11 the BLM returned to the playa to supervise the Post-Event Site Inspection. All of our efforts — every Burner who followed up their commitment to Leaving No Trace by carefully MOOP sweeping the playa, paired with the dedicated work of the Playa Restoration crew — led up to the big game — and it was another close one. Even closer than 2022. Yes, we passed.\n\nThe standard:\n\nOut of the 120 BLM test points, we exceeded the allowable standard on 11 test points. All of the 11 failing test points were in the City Grid — Esplanade to K Street, 2:00 to 10:00 — none of them were on the open playa or other locations outside the City Grid.\n\nRead the full BLM report here.\n\nIn the above graph, you will see the debris average by category: City Grid (2-10 Esplanade to K), Open Playa (2-10 Esplanade to fenceline) Walk-In Camping (2-5 K Street to fenceline), and Other (5-10 K Street to fenceline). In 2023, every category improved.\n\nOf all four categories, the City Grid — where everybody camps — has consistently revealed the most MOOP. Additionally, it is the only category to exceed the 1 sq.ft./acre average. With 90% of the City Grid occupied by placed camps, it is critical for placed camps to uphold the LNT principle with their communities and improve their cleanup performance.\n\nAlso within the City Grid, the open camping areas (non-placed camps) have unfortunately shown a growing MOOP trend, especially on the back blocks. In 2023 there was an entirely red block on the MOOP Map between 8 and 8:15 on K street that required multiple sweeps. In 2022, there was an entirely red block between 8:15 and 8:30 on K street. Is there a coincidence in the nearby locations or is there a consistent trend with lack of accountability? While it is great that there are open camping blocks dedicated to participants who are not necessarily affiliated with theme camps, some of these areas are occupied by big camps and have also become some of the MOOPiest. Without immediate improvement, there will be a need for a process to hold open camping areas accountable.\n\nMOOP Map 2023\n\nIn 2022, we introduced an alternate, “Clear Version” of the MOOP Map where the historical standard color of green was replaced by the color white (clear) to keep the focus on the severity and locations of MOOP.  Moving forward, this will now be the official standard of the MOOP Map.\n\nLooking at the 2023 MOOP Map, you can see that the majority of Black Rock City was clear (formerly green). Great job! However the red areas were especially hard hit and time consuming. We will need to see significant improvement in 2024.\n\nMOOP Trends in 2023\n\nLag Bolts/Tent Stakes/Rebar Were the #1 MOOP (Again), and Even Worse Than Last Year\n\nThe #1 Worst MOOP: Lag bolts/rebar/tent stakes rose from 1,023 to 1,547. Essentially spikes left in the ground, this is the most dangerous MOOP issue on the playa and you need to get a handle on it.\n\nALL SPIKES PUT IN THE GROUND MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REMOVED BY THE PARTICIPANT, CAMP, OR PROJECT THAT PLACED THEM.\n\nAssorted Matter Out of Place\n\nThere were approximately a thousand instances of recorded Assorted Matter Out of Place. This is the button that we press on our GPS app when the types of MOOP are so overwhelmingly varied that it’s impossible to discern one from another. Need a refresher on how to MOOP sweep your camp? Watch this.\n\nCardboard MOOP\n\nMost of the items that failed us on the inspection were cardboard — the cardboard that you put on the ground to walk or drive on, smushed into the ground and left there to harden with the playa. By the time Resto got to it, it was difficult to find, camouflaged by mud, and shaped like playa cracks. We had to use knives to scrape it off the surface. With about 1,000 recorded instances, the cumulative square footage of cardboard had one of the biggest MOOP impacts of 2023.\n\nPlastic Debris\n\nThere was a big bump in plastic debris — up from 308 recorded instances to 1,020. Notable were the fashionable plastic trash bags over boots to keep the mud from sticking: a decent solution, except when they break apart and embed into the playa, and get left behind by their wearer.\n\nWood Debris\n\nUp from 400 to 870 recorded instances, wood debris, the former #1 worst MOOP, more than doubled in 2023. Like cardboard, wood was used to create platforms over the mud, or placed under tires to gain traction. Again, the wood was then left behind in the mud. Pick it up.\n\nBurn Scars\n\nPreviously not a problem, burn scars spiked from 10 to 146. By the looks of it, some of you, during or after the rains, lit fires directly on the ground at your camp. This is prohibited and subject to fine by the BLM.\n\nCarpet/Rug/Textile/Fiber Debris\n\nCarpets take up a lot of area, and with 187 recorded instances in 2023, up from only twenty in 2022, this MOOP is on the rise. So, why this year? The rain? Was your rug wet? Whatever the reason, you need to pack it out.\n\nLeaving No Trace Is Always a Come-from-behind Victory (But It Shouldn’t Be)\n\nWith more than 70,000 participants, the success of the Leaving No Trace principle has always depended squarely on our community. Yes, the Burning Man Black Rock City community remains undefeated since the inception of the BLM Post-Event Site Inspection, but there has never been an inspection that would have passed without the follow-up cleanup effort of the people of Resto.\n\nIf you’re reading this article, chances are you and your crew have a steadfast commitment to Leaving No Trace in BRC. Nonetheless, we all can do better next time, rain or shine. On behalf of my team that stayed behind in the mud for over a month and pulled 1,500 tire-popping lag bolts/stakes/rebar and scraped up embedded cardboard and plastic, and scooped up burn scars — the ultimate responsibility of Leaving No Trace remains with all of you.\n\nIn the coming months, Placement and Resto will be engaging in conversations with the most challenged camps about their LNT plans. We’ll be assessing their MOOP sweep operations, mandating that participants MOOP test their theme camps before departure, and insisting that all lag bolts/stakes/rebar are all accounted for and removed from the playa without a trace. We’re curiouser and curiouser to hear how you plan on Leaving No Trace in 2024, and we know there will be an overall improvement.\n\nPlaya Restoration 2023 Facts",
