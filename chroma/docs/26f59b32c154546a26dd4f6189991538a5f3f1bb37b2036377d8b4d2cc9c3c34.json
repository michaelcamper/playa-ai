  "content": "A hot Sunday morning after the Man burn.\n\nToo bright, too sunny.\n\nWalking down an intersection where people were sitting on both sides of the street in their camps. On lawn chairs, under shade structures, fanning themselves. Recovering after a long night.\n\nA pick-up truck drives slowly past. A bunch of beautiful young men and women are on its bed, smiling and laughing. One girl throws her arms wide and shouts “It’s a beautiful sunny Sunday morning in Black Rock City! Love and blue skies and peace and happiness!”\n\nThey all grin and smile and cheer.\n\nI turn, and can’t help myself.  It just bursts out.\n\n“Apocalypse!” I shout back at them. “Hellfire! Doom and destruction and futility! Night will descend upon us all!”\n\nMy voice fades across the sand.\n\nI thought that would be it.\n\nSuddenly people on both sides of the street are clapping.\n\n“Excellent!” shouts someone to my left.\n\n“Well said!” calls someone to my right.\n\n“Thank you for having the courage to say that!” somebody else on my left says.\n\nAnd then … somehow … the kids on the truck are applauding too.\n\n“Yes!” one of the girls calls out as the truck turns a corner. “I get it now!”\n\nGod I love this place.\n\nCaveat is the Volunteer Coordinator for Media Mecca at Burning Man.
