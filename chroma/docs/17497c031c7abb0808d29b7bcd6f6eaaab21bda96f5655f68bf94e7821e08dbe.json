Thanks Shalaco! – Hun\n\nPlaya Restoration is divided into two specialized teams: Line Sweeps Division and Special Forces.\n\nThe line sweeps walk the city streets, arms length apart in groups of 30 with their well trained MOOP eyes that can spot a single sequin, wood chip or piece of carpet fuzz on the open playa. But when they find something that’s too BIG, too gross, or there’s just too dang many of it, they raise their MOOP stick to flag an oscillator to “cone it”. Taking a few minutes to cleanup what they can, then they walk-on, and keep the line moving. Special Forces will come in for the kill. “Killin Cones” is what these self described “Cone Killas” do.\n\nSo, who is special forces and what does it mean to be a ‘cone killa’ anyways?\nSpecial Forces Manager Phoenix Firestarter breaks it down for us.\n\nThis year kept Special Forces on their toes, with inclement weather forcing an evacuation of the playa for several days, just a few days before the looming BLM inspection required to renew the events annual permit.\n\nA big thanks to Special Forces and the entire Playa Restoration effort for the passion they dedicate to restoring the playa and dissapearo-ing Black Rock City, insuring the BLM Inspection Passed and confirming Burning Man’s reputation as the world’s largest leave no trace event.",
