  "content": "Jakub Mierva of the Bambufonomat Project (Bamboo Element), funded by the Global Art Grants program two years ago, is sharing the wonderful news with us that their interactive musical and visual instrument for four players, as well as work by the Czech artists Jakub Nepraš and Linda Mikolášková, will reach the playa this year.\n\nWatch their charming Indiegogo video to learn more about their dreams and plans for the playa this year. We love this project and are excited to see it in Black Rock City!\n\nBamboo Element creates interactive installations out of bamboo including musical instruments, vehicles, as well as large constructions in nature. The emerging young artist Nepraš has exhibited all over the world and will bring his unique video paintings on plexiglass from his Culture series.\n\nMikolášková is a stage makeup artist and cofounder of Amanitas Fire Theater, a group active in the Czech new circus movement, and she will be doing workshops and performances. They are members of the Clusterf*ck United camp, where all the artwork and workshops will be located. Events will be listed in the Burning Man Playa Events Calendar.",
