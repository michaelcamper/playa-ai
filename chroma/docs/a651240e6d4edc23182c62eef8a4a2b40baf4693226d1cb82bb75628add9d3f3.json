  "content": "Do you remember “Aurora” from Burning Man 2011? This beautiful LED sculpture of a willow tree, with opalescent bark and shiny copper leaves has been installed at Palo Alto City Hall since November 2013. This was a joint effort by the artist Charles Gadeken, Aurora Kids grassroots campaign, Kickstarter donors, Black Rock Arts Foundation, and the Palo Alto Public Art Commission (PAAC.) We have just learned that its placement has been extended by the PAAC for the summer of 2015!\n\nNow … how can you help?\n\nMany thanks from Charles Gadeken and the Aurora crew!",
