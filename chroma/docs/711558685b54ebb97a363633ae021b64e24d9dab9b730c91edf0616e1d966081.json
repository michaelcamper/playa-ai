  "content": "Update: As of 9 a.m., Highway 447 has reopened.\n\nHighway 447 between Empire and Nixon is closed because of a wildfire south of Empire. The Tohakum 2 Fire started Tuesday northwest of Pyramid Lake and is reported to have burned 7,000 acres by Wednesday evening.Â Depending on the direction of the fire, 447 could remain closed for two to 12 hours.\n\nDuring this closure, participants planning to travel from Gerlach to Reno should postpone their departure. Smoke Creek Road, which has sometimes been used as an alternative, is impassable as a result of recent storm damage. Highway 447 north to Cedarville is open. There are no services between Gerlach and Cedarville.\n\nParticipants coming to the event should not proceed on Highway 447 from Interstate 80 and keep an eye on the following sources of up-to-date traffic info:\n\nBurning Man will provide updates via BMIR, IHeartRadio, Facebook and the @BurningMan and @BManTraffic Twitter feeds.\n\nPhoto by Wayne Stadler",
