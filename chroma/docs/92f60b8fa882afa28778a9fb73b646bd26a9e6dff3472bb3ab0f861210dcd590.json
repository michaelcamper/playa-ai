Rising from the ashes of the mysterious and legendary Suicide Club, the Cacophony Society, at its zenith, hosted chapters in over a dozen major cities, and influenced much of what was once called the underground. The Cacophony Society’s epic exploits radically changed the way people live and play in the world. The group inspired Chuck Palahniuk’s Fight Club and Burning Man and helped start pop culture trends including flash mobs, urban exploration, and culture jamming.”\n\nWhat has been said about Tales of the San Francisco Cacophony Society:\n\nJust to give y’all dear readers an idea of the mayhem … Here’s the trailer to Jon Alloway’s long-awaited and recently-premiered Cacophony Society documentary Into the Zone: The Story of the Cacophony Society —\n\n“Into the Zone – The Story of the Cacophony Society” trailer – a film by Jon Alloway\n\nThen … Then! May 31, 2013, there’s kind of the official show, which is NOT the official show. Starring the YES MEN!!! We’ll let the esteemed ringmonster explain it — Chicken John, one of Cacophony’s highest-ranked showmen:\n\nDon’t live in SF? … Cacophony’s going on the road afterwards! … From Carrie Galbraith‘s page:\n\nDisclosure: This writer, Summer Burkes, has three or four pieces in the book, originally published in the heady days of arts journalism and editorship at the San Francisco Bay Guardian, an independently-owned free weekly paper in San Francisco (which is now owned by a corporate megalith, and someone in the I.T. department deleted all the “old” SFBG articles and my “Dilettante” columns from the Internets. *sigh*) … I’ll be reading — ulp, first book reading ever — at City Lights, and maybe other places too.\n\nWord on the street is that on May 16 at City Lights in SF, they’ll be closing off Kerouac Alley so the overflow crowd can watch the party via huge projectors on the walls while they drink at Vesuvio’s and raise a ruckus for the ghosts of the mighty Beat poets who blazed the trail before us. ::shivers::\n\nHope to see y’all there! Invite each and every one of your friends who still believe the horribly streamlined LLC origin story that Larry Harvey somehow drove all the trucks and moved all the things and invented Burning Man all by himself! … And even if you live elsewhere or otherwise can’t make the events, you can pre-order some books for you and your flaming loved ones, straight from the hallowed halls of Last Gasp.\n\nFollow Summer Burkes on Twitter.",
