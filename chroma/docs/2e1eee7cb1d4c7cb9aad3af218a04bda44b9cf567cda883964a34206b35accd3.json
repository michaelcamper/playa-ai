We welcome your voice in the conversation.]\n\nTen years ago I saw a guy dressed like a stockbroker walking along the Esplanade. He was wearing a dust-covered suit and tie, yelling into a cell phone, “Sell, I said! SELL!!!!” It was cute.\n\nLast year I saw quite a few people checking cell phones at Center Camp throughout the week. It was not cute.\n\nOver the years, cell phone & internet access has become more and more accessible at Burning Man – and I think it is a shame. Do I have any right to dictate how someone behaves or “Radically Expresses” themselves? Nope. But I think the Playa’s rare gift of “Immediacy” is in jeopardy.\n\nI was asked about my thoughts this week and clarified my frustration in the video below.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=kQaNrtPYl_A\n\nThese views are solely the views of Halcyon and do not represent the opinions of The Burning Man Organization or Major League Baseball.",
