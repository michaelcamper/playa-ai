  "content": "The Man Kcrew was on the playa last night, and they invited all hands to join them in waxing the Man.\n\nWell, they didn’t really wax him. What they did was melt a bunch of wax, soak burlap in it, then attach it to the Man’s arms and legs. All to make him burn that much brighter in … wow, a week from Saturday!\n\nCrimson Rose, the master of all flame-related customs at Burning Man, was directing the show. It’s a little different this year, because this is the year of Striding Man — the  Man  looks as if he’s in mid-stride. We’re not sure if he’ll assume his normal stance on Burn night, but we DO know that he’ll be able to raise his hands above his head before the fireworks kick off the big burn.",
