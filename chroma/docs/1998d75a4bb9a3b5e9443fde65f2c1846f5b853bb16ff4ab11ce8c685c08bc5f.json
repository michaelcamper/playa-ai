  "content": "Pack your favorite pair of multiverse goggles and join us in the Past, Present and Future for our first ever “trispectral” Desert Arts Preview!\n\nWe are a culture that encourages people to stretch themselves and we are a community that is no stranger to challenge. In fact, we often thrive when there are obstacles and make impossible visions joyfully real.\n\nWhat has been a staple of the San Francisco spring calendar is moving to our collective online spaces. This year’s edition will be presented in three segments that celebrate our community’s triumphant creativity, overcoming challenges via art and creative thinking, and visions for a creative future.\n\n1View: We’ll start with a look back at some ambitious projects that overcame failure and disaster to inspire and amaze us, with a panel discussion featuring artists of Black Rock City.\n\n2View: We’ll meet Burning Man artists who are responding to our current pandemic reality and be inspired by how they are connecting people globally in times of social distancing. You’ll find out how YOU can ignite your own creative fires, join them and inspire others.\n\n3View: Step behind the scenes and join beloved artists for virtual tours of their studios and creative processes, and see how people are continuing their plans and visions for bringing art to a future Black Rock City. Because, of course, Burning Man was always better NEXT year!\n\nIn between segments, visit your choice of three virtual lobbies where you can tour the artist gallery, chat with other participants, or participate in a live art-themed Game Show!\n\nWe encourage you to dress expressively, bring your favorite reusable cup with your beverage of choice for the DIY lobby bar, and pack a favorite playa art story to share should you find yourself chatting with a new friend.\n\nDesert Arts 3View will be one of the first events featured on Kindling, a new dashboard for discovering Burning Man culture, and a gateway for experiencing live events created and hosted by the community. Stay tuned for  more information on this colorful new corner of our multiverse.\n\nMeanwhile, you can pick up your Desert Arts 3View tickets here. See you in the Past, Present and Future!",
