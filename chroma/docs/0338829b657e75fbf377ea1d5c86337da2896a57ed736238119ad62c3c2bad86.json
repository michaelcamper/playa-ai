  "content": "A blatant disregard of some Burning Man principles has recently been reported. That makes this a good time to look at the Principles and the lines we’ve drawn in the sand.\n\nEDIT: This video is a re-upload with unnecessary corporate names omitted.\n\nEDIT #2: I want to thank everyone for the thoughtful discussion in comments.\nI realize now that I made some mistakes.\nI was naive about some things, and ignorant of others.\nI truly believe that the Playa experiences we created were well-aligned with the Principles. But I see now that acknowledgement of any brand, in any way, at any time, in relation to Burning Man – on or off Playa – is problematic.\nHopefully this conversation will help us move forward as a community.\n\n**NOTE: I AM NOT AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF BURNING MAN. I am merely a Participant with a passion for the event, people, and principles of Burning Man. Half-baked ideas & views expressed aren’t necessarily those of the Burning Man organization.” **",
