  "content": "Burners Without Borders volunteers have been closely watching the relief efforts on the East Coast following the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy. Our hearts go out to those who are suffering in the aftermath of the storm. With millions of people affected by Sandy and with so many people without flood insurance, the recovery effort will be challenging and lengthy.\n\nBWB has deployed an assessment team to New Jersey, led by BWB Co-founder and Director of Operations for Katrina, Richard Scott. During the 8 months BWB was deployed on the Gulf Coast in the wake of Katrina, Richard’s incredible heavy machinery skills enabled BWB to gift over $1million worth of debris removal to the region. When Hurricane Ike struck three years later, Richard was there to remove destroyed houses, so that those affected could quickly recover and move forward with their lives.\n\nThis week, Richard will be meeting with our local contacts in New Jersey to tour affected areas that are not receiving relief assistance. BWB’s mission is to fill in the gaps of the major recovery effort, and we will be looking for the most effective way to accomplish this goal.\n\nRichard is currently in contact with heavy machinery companies who have donated machines to BWB in the past. We are also looking into possibly creating a base of operations in New Jersey for a larger volunteer deployment.\n\nWe will be providing updates to this list as they become available.\n\nYou can also keep up with updates on the BWB Facebook Page.\n\nHow can you help?\n\n1. BWB is currently seeking introductions to equipment rental companies that would like to support our efforts.\n2. We are seeking a community center or public space in New Jersey to set up a base of operations for a potential volunteer deployment.\n3. Do you have information about communities that are hard hit but receiving little help? We want to know about them.\n\nE-mail sandyrelief@burnerswithoutborders.org with any information you have that can support the relief effort.\n\nYou can donate to the BWB relief effort by clicking clicking here.",
