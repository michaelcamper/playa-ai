  "content": "Hi there!  Has it been a while since you’ve opened a Jackrabbit Speaks?  Did you miss the last few (very pretty, graphical) editions?\n\nThere could be a reason for that.  We recently changed email service providers, which may have created confusion for your email filters. Here’s what’s changed:\n\nSo, if you didn’t receive a JRS this month, it’s possible your beloved JRS is sitting — lonely, sad, abandoned (*sniff*) — in your SPAM folder or was filtered off to God-knows-where, and you might need to update your email filters.\n\nApologies for the inconvenience. We look forward to continuing to serve you with our newfangled graphical JRS.\n\n– The Jackrabbits",
