  "content": "The holiday season can be an amazing opportunity to practice Gifting. Or it can be a depressing display of Gifting losing its magic.\n\nWhen mutual gifting is mandatory…it can feel like a transaction.\n\nLuckily, there are more and more examples being shared of giving gifts that are actually gifts for the recipient to give away. This is a beautiful way to turn the holiday madness upside down and return to amazing Gifting experiences like the ones we treasure so much on the Playa. In this video I discuss a recent viral video that embraces Gifting and share a couple last minute “Pay it Forward” gifts that don’t require a trip to the mall. (Please share other ideas in the comments!)",
