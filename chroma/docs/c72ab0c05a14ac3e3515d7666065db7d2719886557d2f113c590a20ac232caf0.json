  "content": "Welcome to Tomorrow Today and this year’s edition of how ten remarkable artists proposed a vision for the Pavilion, the podium upon which the 2025 Man will rise. As you will see, there are many ways to view the role of the Pavilion — some reflections on tomorrow of yesteryear, tomorrow tomorrow, and yes, Tomorrow Today. Each unique and each a gift to the community.\n\nThe artists invited to submit a concept reflect a range of design impulses and backgrounds; all share in common a love of Burning Man and a passion for the work they create in Black Rock City. As you will discover, participating in Burning Man was a catalyst for these artists’ creative journeys. Over the years, they drew inspiration from Burning Man, began bringing art, and ultimately were tapped to submit creative concepts for the 2025 Man Pavilion. Black Rock City has a way of turning people into artists, then inspiring them to build audacious things. What do YOU dream of creating?\n\nLet’s get to know the creators behind this year’s Man Pavilion concepts — their art, and the designs they submitted. Gradually, we’ll make our way to sharing this year’s chosen design.\n\nAntwane Lee\n\nAntwane began by making art for Regional Events in the Midwest before and submitting a proposal to bring an Honoraria artwork to Black Rock City. Awarded a grant but delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Antwane brought “The Solar Shrine” to Black Rock City in 2022. Self-described as an Afro-Futurist, Antwane is both an architect and an artist who lives in Chicago.\n\nAntwane says about Burning Man:\n\nZach Coffin\n\nIt rarely gets more epic than Zach Coffin and his love affair with rocks. His first Burning Man was 1996 and his first art project was supporting Michael Christian’s “Bone Arch” in 1997. By 2000 when the theme was “Body” he brought his first big rock, to represent the kidney. Larry Harvey asked him to make it spin (because, Larry) and that became Zach’s first “Rockspinner.” In 2023 Zach’s recent version of “Rockspinner” was opened to the public at Google’s Gradient Canopy Plaza in Mountain View. Zach tells us, “Why I started doing work at Burning Man is a very long discussion and the How could fill a book.” “Temple of Gravity,” at Black Rock City 2003 and again in 2017, had a total weight estimate of 180,000 lb..\n\nwww.zacharycoffin.com\n\nJon Sarriugarte and Kyrsten Mate with Zolie Sarriugarte\n\nThis dynamic family trio boomeranged into the Brutalist past and brought back a mid-century approach to space age buildings for their submission. You wouldn’t think that the history of Burning Man artists goes back further than Zach Coffin, yet it does, as we listen to the unwinding tale of Jon’s Burning Man experience:\n\nBurning Man has been a vital part of my creative journey since I first set foot on the playa in 1995. It’s not just an event—it’s a crucible of creativity, experimentation, and human connection that has shaped who I am as an artist, designer, builder, and collaborator. Before Burning Man, I was deeply involved in the Cacophony Society, where absurdity, chaos, and creativity collided in the most unexpected ways.\n\nKyrsten Mate, Jon’s creative and life partner is a sound designer with a phenomenal approach to immersive environments, audio, and participatory experiences. Working in the world of sound design is a labor of joy for her. As well as shaping sound, Kyrsten shapes metal, creates fantastical color schemes for art, and produces immersive sound art pieces that work in concert with large scale sculptures. Kyrsten is currently a sound designer at Skywalker Sound in Marin, California.\n\nOne final important collaborator to note is Kyrsten and Jon’s daughter Zolie Mae Sarriugarte, a sculptor and artist in her own right. Returning once again to Jon’s words:\n\nwww.formandreform.com/\n\nMiguel Guzman and Ivyone Khoo\n\nTaking us back to the future are multimedia eco-artists, Miguel and Ivyone. Sculpting in mycelium, plankton, and upcycled materials, they truly ‘grow their own’ when it comes to art and materials. First time Honoraria art grant recipients in 2017, they’ve returned to Black Rock City many times in the last six years. Climate and conservation conscious, their artistry exemplifies how we can take care of the future through our choices today.\n\nIn their words:\n\nChristopher Breedlove\n\nWith the inspiration of infinity and a dedication to a regenerative future, Christopher Breedlove is a constant inspiration and his impact over time is beyond measure. Christopher’s involvement with Burning Man goes back 19 years, first as a Regional Contact, and then as the leader for Burners Without Borders. His design includes an ‘infinity walk’ inviting us to connect with the cyclical nature of time, innovation, and the eternal quest for a better future. Underneath he designed a gallery walk where innovative and regenerative ideas from across the community can be shared — something we plan to explore with the design we selected.\n\nChristopher states:\n\nDiane Hoffoss and Gordon Hoople\n\nThere is nothing mundane about Diane and Gordon’s vision for Tomorrow Today. In fact it’s spectacular and audacious and beautiful. We think of it as Tomorrow Tomorrow — and just a bit beyond reach. Titled “Equilibrium,” Diane and Gordon offer in their design narrative:\n\nWhen asked about how they first began to come to Burning Man they share that a single math professor came and was inspired in 2016, which then became this story:\n\nDiane and Gordon’s Man Pavilion design – nighttime view: “Equilibrium”\n\nCjay Roughgarden, Stephanie Shipman, Jacquelyn Scott\n\nA powerful trio of women artists and builders from the Bay Area, most recently known for their 2024 art project “Naga & the Captainess,” we were excited to see what their conception for the Man Pavilion would entail. Their vision was grand and even proposed a village within the heart of the city. Their collective knowledge and experience is impressive. Jacquelyn works as a production and scenic designer for theater and film. Stephanie Shipman is a woodworker, artist, designer and teacher. Cjay is an artist and architectural metal fabricator. They are all kick ass.\n\nJacquelyn states:\n\nwww.cjayroughgarden.com | About “Naga & the Captainess”\n\nSilvia Rueda\n\nColombian architect Silvia Rueda runs Understory Creative Studio, where they create immersive installations that take inspiration from natural systems — particularly fungi and their interconnected networks. Their projects address contemporary challenges such as urban isolation, while fostering community connections through technology. Silvia’s design titled, “Healing Forest” is elegant and subdued, drawing on recycled wood and relying on lighting to animate. The creative concept is constructed along with a poetic narrative. It seems best to share a portion of that narrative as the inspiration is vast and timely:\n\nRueda’s Man Pavilion design – exterior view: “Healing Forest”\n\nwww.understorystudio.co\n\nWilliam Nemitoff\n\nGrand vision, Buckminster Fuller, a global presence, are all encompassed in Wiiliam Nemitoff’s concept design. He is an artist, designer, and founder of Curious Form, an art studio specializing in digital fabrication and large-scale installations. Informed by William’s Master of Architecture degree, his work bridges the worlds of design, engineering, and public art. Rooted in the belief that art has the power to inspire connection and joy, his interactive sculptures and installations invite audiences to play, explore, and rediscover their sense of wonder. You may recall his artwork “Dream Slide,” a playful, yet lovely, unicorn slide at Black Rock City 2024.\n\nAbout his design, William says:\n\nwww.curiousform.com\n\nMark Rivera – Selected Design\n\nLet’s get personal and share with you about Mark Rivera in his own words:\n\nI first learned about Burning Man back in the dial up days of the internet, and it had always been on my bucket list. In 2022, I ran into a friend at a bar and she offered me a ticket. Looking back now, it was one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nBorn on March 2, 1975, in Panama City to Puerto Rican parents, I relocated to Puerto Rico in the late 1980s. By the early 2000s, I had established myself as a multifaceted professional, excelling in building, art direction, woodworking, welding, and general contracting across the film and art industries. Simultaneously, I toured as a musician, which broadened my understanding of art and its transformative power.\n\nIn 2013, I moved to Santurce, Puerto Rico, where my home became a creative hub for a street art movement. Collaborating with fellow artists, I found my passion for sculptural work, specializing in large scale mixed media creations.\n\nIn 2023, I was selected to bring art to Burning Man. At the same time, I was displaced from my apartment in Puerto Rico, which had been sold to an investor. With no other options, I had to move on and to a Puerto Rican friend’s shop in California to focus on the sculpture.\n\nFueled by the frustration and anger of that situation, I created “Jíbaro Soy” — a piece to show the world who I am and where I come from. A 20-foot jíbaro, with his shirt open, revealing his essence, his people, and his barrio. With his pava and two machetes in hand, he stands to protect his culture and identity, sending a message to the world no one can take who I am.\n\nAnd so we present to you Mark Rivera’s design, “The World Fair of Unity.” As Mark describes it:",
