I like to support local artists and “keep money in the family,” so I hired my wonderful neighbor who runs a small seamstress business.\n\nI gave her my playa coat design along with this kick-ass iridescent pink and black striped fabric I found. I hired her to sew in the fabric as the new lining, put in deeeeeep pockets with snapping closures, and add other snazzy features. My functional festival coat let me freely hop, skip, bike, romp and noodle-leg all over the playa without carrying a backpack or having my playa party favors fall out of my pockets. I have to admit, I’m pretty proud of my funky “FUN-ktional Own Creation!”\n\nI was grateful to my seamstress neighbor, and after the 2016 Burn, I sent her a note of thanks along with this photo:\n\nShe loved it! In fact, she loved it so much she asked, “Would you mind if I used that photo of you wearing the coat on my seamstress website? It’s a great photo… and that beautiful lighthouse structure behind you is amazing!”\n\nI told her that using images of an artist’s work requires their permission, but that Burning Man art can’t be used commercially anyway. I was happy to let her use a photo of me wearing the coat on her site, but images of Burning Man can’t be used to sell products.\n\nShe replied, “But I’m not selling the coat. I just want to use that photo on my seamstress website to demonstrate my work. … And that lighthouse behind you is just so beautiful!”\n\nI realized she was genuinely puzzled by the issue. I also realized I had an opportunity for a “teachable moment” on the Burning Man ethos, including Decommodification and Media Rights and Responsibilities (not to mention copyright law, trademark law and persona rights).\n\nI asked her, “As an artist yourself, would you be okay with your art being used without your knowledge or permission to sell cars, or auto insurance, or other things?” From that perspective, she got the point. The difference is, she runs a small business, and sometimes she would want to give permission to someone who wanted to use her work in a promotion. Burning Man culture, however, is decommodified — its imagery shouldn’t be used commercially at all.\n\nThe really good news is that I was able to offer an alternative solution that would meet her needs another way:\n\nI told her, “I’m going to be at another event in a few weeks, and I’ll be wearing the festival coat along with the rest of the outfit. I will take more photos in a neutral location, you can pick your favorites, and post those photos of me on your website.”\n\nThis is the photo I sent to her, shot in a neutral location outside a warehouse.\n\nThis solution was a win-win that worked for everyone.\n\nMost people will do the right thing if they know the right thing to do. However, like my seamstress neighbor, people may not know what the right solutions are, or they may not have fully explored Burning Man’s principles and policies in the first place. Let’s talk about how to do it right.\n\nHow to Share the Culture Without Screwing It Up\n\nBurning Man’s principles and policies are in place to create a container for radical human experimentation in community, creativity, freedom, self-expression, and gifting. The container of Burning Man is sort of like a petri dish for humans, where people can co-create together and experience each other in an environment radically different from the default world.\n\nTo foster this experience, as a condition of attending Burning Man (which is a private event) participants agree not to use photos shot at Burning Man for financial gain or commerce. In addition to the Burning Man ethos and principles, there are also “really real” Federal copyright laws that prohibit photos depicting another’s art and “really real” state laws prohibiting the use of photos of people for financial gain or in connection with commerce. And please don’t use “Burning Man” to sell your stuff, because there are “really real” Federal trademark laws, too.\n\nBy way of example, just imagine this shit show…\n\nA participant prints up a bunch of “Burning Man” tee shirts with an image of the Man on the front. He asks a passerby to take a photo of him wearing it while standing in front of playa art next to several unsuspecting naked and happy Burners (who may be homemakers, teachers, doctors, office workers, or whatever back home). He then posts that photo on his website to sell the shirts. Please don’t be that guy. You do not want to deal with the pain and expense that will follow from the fallout.\n\nSo what CAN you do? A lot of things! To that end, here is a brief guide:\n\nRespecting the artists’ work on the playa is good, loving and right. Helping to protect the Burning Man mark from being diluted by commercial exploitation will go a long way toward supporting this extraordinary ongoing experiment in Decommodification and other Burning Man principles. So thank you to all you heart-centered good people out there for your willingness to step up and do the right thing!",
