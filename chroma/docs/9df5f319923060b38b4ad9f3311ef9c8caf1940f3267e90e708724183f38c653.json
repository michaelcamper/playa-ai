  "content": "The playa showed a bit of her history,\nNot wet, but soft and sticky,\nGrowing around my feet,\nLike she wanted to cover me with,\nA muddy gown, clinging to my soul,\n\nThe shadows laid out like spider’s legs,\nLong and black, straight and crisp as we embraced,\nThe sun, just now orange and half gone,\nWas giving up the last of his day’s warmth,\nAnd, we layered on the costumes,\nBright and shiny, soft and silky,\nStill sexy, not giving in to it,\nExpression is our skin,\n\nMother Nature’s cold embrace,\nPaws at our bodies, numbed by,\nFuzzy eyes and the vibrations that come,\nFrom a life’s worth of love,\nRounded out by the comforting,\nHug of a dusty nest, that was made for us all.\n\nby Christopher Robin Drake AKA, Ace",
