  "content": "Do you gift snow cones? Host show tune singalongs? Love to tango? Lead random parades to nowhere? Whatever you love to create, YOU are invited to bring it to Center Camp — an acre of beautifully designed, communal shaded space in the beating heart of Black Rock City.\n\nCenter Camp is holding space for spontaneous offerings and walk-up creators of all kinds. At any given time you may meet (or be!) a tap-dancing platypus, java-slinging cephalopod or rhinoceros puppeteer. It’s an ANIMALIA circus inspired by YOU.\n\nFill out this form to tell us what you’re bringing to Center Camp, and to request resources that will help make it sparkle.\n\nYou don’t need to fill out a form to come and get playful with everyone. BUT if you’re creating something that will be anchored in time and space, or that needs power, tell us about it. We may be able to reserve a spot and support your electrical needs in one of our shiny new Activation Bays.\n\nAre you an artist? Plan an installation or experience, drop in with your work, or create a masterpiece on the spot. Fill out this form to tell us all about what’s in your imagination, and what you plan to bring!\n\nAlready part of a fully-interactive theme camp? Shake things up in the center of town with a pop-up experience. Want to test out a new offering or experiment? Or want your camp’s gifts to reach a wider audience? Bring it on down.\n\nWill you be in open camping? Or maybe you keep a low profile in walk-in camping but have ALWAYS wanted to do a little interactive pop-up? Bring your unique flavor of playa magic into the heart of the city or test run a new idea — it’s like having a fully shaded theme camp (without the logistics).\n\nAre you a dancer, yogi, performance artist, circus impresario? Come out and play, dance, tumble and teach beneath Center Camp’s vast shaded panels.\n\nDo you build, produce, MC, stage manage, decorate? We’re looking for builders, artists, decorators, musicians, wranglers, ringmasters, stage managers and more.\n\nVolunteering in Center Camp is fun and we’d love to have you. Learn more here, then fill out the Volunteer Questionnaire in your Burner Profile — be sure to tell us you’re interested in Center Camp!\n\nWhatever you love to do, show up, bring your thing, and your dusty friends. Center Camp is a giant rumpus room for dusty humanimals of all stripes and species to gather, play, and meet their neighbors.",
