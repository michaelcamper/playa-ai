Community gatherings and events are one pathway, and a very popular one this season. With over 80 annual Official Regional Events taking place across five continents, it’s fair to say that the global community is alive and well!\n\nFor those that ventured to Black Rock City this summer, the change of seasons and arrival of fall is often met by the responsibility and privilege of unpacking. Unpacking not only dusty gear and boxes, but experiences. The work of processing your Burning Man experience and embodying the ups and downs of your personal decompression can be hard work. For some, returning to daily routines and responsibilities may come easily; others may experience waves of disorientation and flashbacks to life in Black Rock City. If you’re missing the dust, there are a myriad of ways to connect with fellow Burners this fall!\n\nOfficial Regional Events range from one day urban burns, to week long gatherings in the mountains, to beach cleanups, and civic art events. While there’s an array of events taking place across the Burner diaspora, right now is undoubtedly Decompression season. When I asked $teven Ra$pa, Burning Man’s Community Events Producer and artist extraordinaire, why we host Decompressions, he said:\n\nLast month there were Decompression events held in Chicago, Denver, Venice Beach, Victoria, BC., and Wales. October and November will host another handful of official Decom events, including:\n\nReno Decompression– October 7, 2017 in Reno, Nevada\n\nBurnOut– October 7, 2017 in Portland, Oregon\n\nIdaho Decompression– October 5-8, 2017 in Twin Springs, Idaho\n\nAZ Decompression– October 12-15, 2017 in Tucson, Arizona\n\nLA Decompression– October 14, 2017 in Los Angeles, California\n\nSan Francisco Decompression– October 14, 2017 in San Francisco, California\n\nSeaCompression– October 14 and 15, 2017 in Burien, Washington\n\nBoulder DustOff– October 21, 2017 in Boulder, Colorado\n\nRadical Ritual- Second Life– October 21-29, 2017 in the virtual world\n\nUtah Decompression– October 28, 2017 in South Salt Lake, Utah\n\nLondon Decompression– November 10, 2017 in London, England\n\nDustcovery– November 11, 2017 in Vancouver, Canada\n\ntaBURNak! 8– November 11, 2017 in Montreal, Canada\n\nLithuania Decom– November 18, 2017 in Vilnius, Lithuania\n\nMoscow Decompression– November 25, 2017 in Moscow, Russia\n\nYou can visit Burning Man’s Global Network page to see a full listing of events around the world and find out how you can create community year-round.\n\nIf you’d like to work on planning a local event to bring Burners together, we encourage you to reach out to your local Regional Contact and get things started!\n\nEnjoy the change of seasons (and self), and happy Decompression!\n\nTop photo by Andrey Frazão",
