For many people, acquiring a ticket to Black Rock City is the beginning of the journey; it’s when it all starts to feel real. Lots of the other planning components tend to fall into place a little easier once you have a ticket. There are some important things to note as we head into the 2020 ticketing season, so here’s the update many of you have been waiting for.\n\nWe know the 2019 Main Sale did not go well for many of you. Over the last nine months, we’ve done a thorough review of what happened, and have taken steps to ensure this year goes more smoothly. Our Ticketing and Technology teams have been hard at work exploring ways to ensure the stability of our systems and the efficiency and accountability of our fulfillment process, and to make the ticket-buying process less stressful and more equitable. We are giving careful consideration of what to change and what not to change to lessen risk and improve outcomes.\n\nYou’ll still need to create or update your Burner Profile, there will still be a pre-registration period through your Profile, and there will be a sale date. The order of the sales will be the same as last year: Directed Group Sale (DGS), FOMO, Main Sale, Directed Group Sale 2, and OMG. You will still be able to buy a maximum of two (2) tickets and one (1) vehicle pass during the Directed Group, FOMO, Main, and OMG Sales.\n\nYou will notice some changes including an increase in the Main Sale and DGS ticket prices (now $475), due in large part to the fact that the cost of building a fully functioning temporary city in the desert increases yearly. In 2019, we faced additional costs related to the years-long Environmental Impact Statement process, and we also made strategic investments to further our nonprofit mission. Please see our recently published 990 and this page for more info about where money from ticket sales goes, and our Annual Report for more information about our work beyond the playa.\n\nYou will also see an increase in the cost for a vehicle pass (now $140). We have to begin taking concrete steps towards a sustainable event and global culture, and we hope this increase will encourage many of you to carpool, or consider hopping on the Burner Express.\n\nLow-Income tickets will remain $210 each, and FOMO tickets will remain $1,400 each.\n\nIn all of our ticketing decisions, we continue to try to find the right balance. We created the Directed Group Sale in 2013 to ensure Black Rock City’s core contributors have access to the event. That year we also created Burner Profiles to make the process smoother. As part of our Cultural Course Correcting initiative, we told you about our increase in DGS and Low Income ticket numbers.\n\nThe Low-Income Ticket Program aims to promote Radical Inclusion so the event is accessible to more participants; the FOMO Sale encourages those who can afford higher-price tickets to contribute at that level and help to subsidize lower priced sales; and the OMG Sale is our attempt to help Burners get to Black Rock City at the last minute. We’ve also published pieces to help you know more about how you can help the fight against scalpers.\n\nThere’s no perfect solution for an event where demand for access far outpaces availability of tickets, but we do our best to create a fair system that ensures a wide variety of people are able to participate in Black Rock City each year. We hope to see you in 2020! If not in Black Rock City, then at one of more than 100 official Regional Events around the world, or through a Burners Without Borders project. Let’s make Burning Man happen everywhere!\n\nDetails for this year’s sales are now available at tickets.burningman.org.\n\nTop photo by SN Jacobson",
