  "content": "Did you know that 447, the road to Burning Man, runs through Washoe County? Of course you did. We’ve been working with the county for 25 years to make all this possible. But you probably didn’t know that the county just got a $75,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to help establish a 200-mile interactive, participatory trail highlighting art, history, and culture.\n\nThat’s a big deal!\n\nThis project is a collaboration between Washoe County, Burning Man Project, and numerous local nonprofit and municipal partners, and will cross through Reno/Sparks, up to Pyramid Lake, and continue to Gerlach. The trail is estimated to take two years to complete.\n\nAs a nonprofit that seeks to expand art to civic spaces beyond Black Rock City, we’re excited for another chance to put the “Project” in Burning Man Project. Burning Man co-founder Crimson Rose summed it up well when she said, “We are excited to work with Washoe County on this new project highlighting the importance of art in the world.”\n\nCommunity input will be part of this collaborative process, so stay tuned for more information!\n\nCheck out the full release here.\n\nPhoto of Guru Road, courtesy of travelnevada.com",
