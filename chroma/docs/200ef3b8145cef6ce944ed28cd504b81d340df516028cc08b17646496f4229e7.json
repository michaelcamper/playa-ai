  "content": "As people begin to check-off their pre-burn packing lists, many are puzzled by the same question: “What should I bring as gifts?”\n\nBut Gifting is about much more than brown paper packages tied up with strings. In fact, Gifting is one of my favorite things…\n\nThe (non-official) 10 Commandments of Gifting:\n\n1) Gifting is a physical demonstration of Love. \n“I want you to have this because it makes me happy to see you happy.”\n\n2) Gifting dissolves separation. \nWhen you Gift, you are breaking down the wall between me and you/ us and them. If you EXCHANGE, then you are re-enforcing the separation. But to GIFT is to say, You and I are one.\nWhen I understand the interconnectedness of all things, then Gifting helps to show that I cannot ever lose anything. If I gift you something, I am only transferring it from one part of the One to another. There is no loss and no gain. We are just shifting possession to an aspect of the whole that will appreciate it more. Think “Osmosis of Material Goods.”\n\n3) A Gift can be ANYTHING. \nIt can be a song, an idea, a massage, a sculpture, a compliment, a sticker, a shoulder to lean on, a wet-nap, a walk home, or a hug.\n\n4) Gifting eliminates hoarding and creates abundance. \nWhen we allow ”stuff” to flow more fluidly between one another, ALL stuff becomes an available resource to ALL people. Gifting breaks down attachment.\n\n5) Gifting helps dissolve the Ego. \nWhen we become less connected with owning and having stuff (even our skills and talents) then we identify less with our physical selves. We take less credit for things and less blame. Who we are becomes more about our divine seed than our story or physical form.\n\n6) Gifting breaks the commerce paradigm. \nTraditional commerce = an even exchange. You get one, I lose one. You pay one, I earn one. Sum total = Zero (0). But in a gift, You receive the gift (+1) AND I feel good for giving the gift (+1). Sum total = Two (2).\n\n7) Gifting releases the flow of energy between people. \nWe are hardly even aware of the energetic walls that we maintain to hold on to our stuff and keep out yours. The more we gift, the less those barriers hold.\n\n8) Gifting opens up the world. \nMaking a habit of gifting allows you to see every interaction as an opportunity for increased Joy – even if there is no benefit to you specifically. If I have something (a bite of food, a word of support, a warm hat) that can make your life better, then I can make MY life better by helping YOU. That means there are billions of opportunities in every moment to make the planet more joyful. On the other hand, if the only way to increase joy is by helping out my specific individual self, then the opportunities are few.\n\n9) Gifting is never required. \nA feeling of obligation cancels out the Gift. (This type of “Barter” exchange is often confused as gifting.) But if you expect anything in return – even the elimination of guilt – then the magic of Gifting has been compromised.\n\n10) EVERY interaction can be seen as an act of Gifting.\n\nThese views are solely the views of Halcyon and do not represent the opinions of The Burning Man Organization.",
