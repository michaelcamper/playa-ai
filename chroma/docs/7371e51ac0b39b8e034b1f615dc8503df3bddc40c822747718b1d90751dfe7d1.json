Arraiz is a Spanish architect living in Valencia, and the Burning Man Regional Contact for the Spain – Valencia community.\n\nThe Design\n\nThe Temple of the Deep embodies both strength and fragility. Inspired by ancient volcanic rocks from the surrounding Black Rock Desert landscape, it is a sanctuary for shared reflection and healing.\n\nMiguel’s design is a bold evolution from recent Temple designs, with a natural yet futuristic vision that is both raw and ornate. Rich layers of meaning underlie the 44-foot-high by 105-foot-diameter design, exploring concepts of light and dark, personal and communal, and the power of honoring our journey. Step into the 3D model to understand what it will feel like in the space.\n\nCrafted from wood, the monolithic black rock evokes power and represents a connection to the personal depths that we develop through loss and healing. Reminiscent of organic places of shelter — such as caves, rocks, and mountains — the Temple will be a space where participants can connect, reflect, find meaning, and tap into the mysticism of the Earth.\n\nIts fractured surface, symbolizing the heart and soul shattered into a thousand pieces, glows from within, creating a captivating interplay of light and shadow. The design references kintsugi, the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold, celebrating flaws as sources of strength and beauty rather than hiding them, reminding us that healing comes from exploring, not erasing, the journey.\n\nThe radial symmetry and alcove shapes create a sense of balance with the striking exterior design. Seven entrances signify the seven stages of grief, guiding participants along introspective healing paths that converge in the shared central space. The interior seating mirrors BRC’s city plan, embracing unity and transforming it into a space for communal healing.\n\nMiguel invites us all to see ourselves reflected in the Temple’s philosophy of radical acceptance. It is a space for honoring your own journey and finding peace in its imperfection.\n\nThe Lead Artist and Team\n\nMiguel Arraiz brings a global perspective to the Temple as the first Spanish native to lead the project, reflecting Burning Man’s thriving international community.\n\nA childhood dream of being a poet and architect led him to architecture, but the 2008 financial crisis pushed him toward ephemeral art. His 15 years creating burnable art for Valencia’s Las Fallas festival unknowingly prepared him for a life-changing encounter with Burning Man in 2015 and 2016. Collaborating with pink intruder on Renaixement, an Honorarium artwork exhibited in both Black Rock City and Valencia, Miguel discovered parallels between the fiery spirit of Las Fallas and Burning Man’s ethos of innovation, community, and impermanence. (Check out this documentary!)\n\nNow, leading the Temple of the Deep — a project inspired by love, reflection, and respect — Miguel collaborates with Spanish colleagues including Javier Molinero, Arqueha, and Javier Bono, plus seasoned Temple Builders Guild members and other experienced leads from recent years to create a celebration of community and global collaboration.\n\nStay tuned in the coming weeks for a podcast all about this year’s Temple artist and a Journal post covering all things Temple, from its builders to its guardians.\n\nThe Selection Process\n\nAfter 25 years of the Temple tradition, Black Rock City has seen many remarkable Temple designs. We owe much to David Best for initiating the tradition and shaping the Temple’s design for years. And, as an organization at the forefront of creativity, Burning Man Project embraces innovation and experimentation.\n\nThe Temple of the Deep breaks from tradition with a bold new design. The Temple tradition allows diverse styles as long as the design provides a non-denominational, welcoming space for thousands of participants and their offerings. It must also meet practical requirements, including a feasible build plan and limited installation time on playa.\n\nMiguel’s design stood out for its imagination and depth. From the cracked black rock symbolizing resilience to the open interior fostering connection, its nuanced meaning made it a compelling choice. We also appreciated its potential to inspire new creative directions.\n\nWhile design is key, the integrity and leadership of the lead artist are equally important — Miguel’s leadership, sincere passion, and selfless motivation were deeply impressive. It’s also exciting to feature only the third Temple by an international artist.\n\nMiguel’s journey — from Valencia’s Fallas festival to the 2025 Temple — embodies Burning Man’s spirit of participation. With a vision, a willingness to collaborate, and a big dash of grit, you too can create something extraordinary.\n\nYOU Can Participate in the Temple!\n\nAnyone — regardless of skill or background — can contribute to this powerful symbol of connection, healing, and reflection. The Temple of the Deep will come to life through the hands, hearts, and minds of many. Its creation is not just a feat of architectural brilliance but an act of community-building. While some leads are already in place, there are still many opportunities to join. The build will be based in the Bay Area, but roles are available for both remote and in-person participation. Fill out this form to get involved!\n\nYou can also contribute written offerings to the Temple, even if you can’t attend BRC. Look for more details in the coming months. Your participation makes Temple of the Deep a true gift for all — a space to reflect, connect, and release.\n\nBe the Artist You Are!\n\nWith a vision and the willingness to try, anyone can be an artist at Burning Man. Whether designing large-scale or small-scale artworks, joining a build crew, or creating other interactive experiences, step out of the spectator seat and into the ring.\n\nBurning Man is something to create, not consume. Whatever it is, we invite you to bring your artistic vision to life. The creation of the Temple of the Deep exemplifies how collaboration and determination make the extraordinary possible.",
