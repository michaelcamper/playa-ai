It’s not about the environment per se; rather it’s about the impact the environment on the playa has on you, and what you can do about it. More to the point, it’s about playa dust, your nose, and how to make them live happily together.  And it’s another post from our dear friend Molly Golightly–you can see the red headed menace in this photo from BM2k.3\n\nOK? OK.\n\nFrom Molly: “Neti Pot: Saver Of Sinuses\n\nPlaya boogers happen. They are terrifying nose goblins of previously\nunknown proportions. I don’t want to know how something that big came\nout of a nose a small as mine, but it happens. Caustic playa dust\nwrecks havoc on sinuses and dries out the nostrils. For years burners\nhave been advising to bring squirty bottles of saline and tissues to\nalleviate Extreme Playa Nose. But those little plastic bottles aren’t\nvery earth-friendly ( I came home with TEN!! empties one year) and I’ve found a more effective means of nasal/sinus irrigation and health: the neti pot.\n\nLet me state that the neti pot (also spelled netti) has changed my\nlife. It has eased my allergies by pushing out particles that can’t be\nreached by the saline squirty spray bottle. I use my neti pot every\nday and my eyes are less red and my head is less congested. On the\nplaya the neti pot is like a shower for the inside of your head.\nRefreshing!\n\nNeti pots are an ancient Indian remedy. You fill the small pot with\nwarm water and (for smoothest results) non-iodized non-sea salt. It\ntakes a bit of practice but essentially the water is poured in one\nnostril, travels through the sinuses of the head, and out the other\nnostril — bringing it with it debris, boogers, dust, whatever you’ve\ngot up there. Now you do the other side. The lowly saline bottle has\nnothing on the effects of the neti.\n\n[note: if you want to see one in action, click here–but be warned the person in the video looks like they’re a robot. it’s a little creepy, actually]\n\nYou can find them online or I bought mine at the health food store.\nSome are ceramic, others are glass. Ceramic is probably more\nplaya-friendly.\n\nA final thought–I know it’s Burning Man and all, but please: don’t share your neti pot.”\n\n-MGL",
