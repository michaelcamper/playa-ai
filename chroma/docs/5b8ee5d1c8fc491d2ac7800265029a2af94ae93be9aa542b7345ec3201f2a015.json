But building the Temple takes many months of planning, so in our ongoing efforts to support artists we want to give the 2020 Temple artist and crew as much time as possible to create the space we will all come to love next year.\n\nThe Temple is often the largest participant-created art installation on playa. It’s an incredibly complex undertaking, with a crew in the hundreds, fundraising goals of over $100K, and a real labor of love.\n\nWho is Eligible to Submit an Application to Build the Temple?\n\nNew in 2020, the lead artist of the Temple must have been to Black Rock City at least once and they must have participated in building something while there, preferably a relatively large or complex project. The environment and culture in BRC is unlike anywhere else on earth, and having build experience on playa will ensure greater success for the Temple artist and crew.\n\nClick for caption details\n\nDesign Elements: What Are We Looking For?\n\nEvery year, we explore a spectrum of design ideas from our community’s artists and builders, and we approach our decision with the goal of creating a special physical space on playa for Black Rock City’s citizens to share their reflections.\n\nThe Temple design should not be based on a particular religion, belief, or theme as it’s meant to be inclusive for all citizens.\n\nWhile we do like each Temple to have its own unique characteristics, there are certain design elements we look for in a successful proposal, such as protected niches for participants to leave offerings, a central gathering space, and multiple entrances/exits.\n\nWhat is the Selection Process?\n\nThe selection is made by an art grant committee that has a long history of being involved with Burning Man Arts’ annual grant cycles and award processes. This committee has extensive personal experience in creating and managing art on playa.\n\nWe make our selection from the proposals that are submitted; most years we receive about a dozen applications. The committee reads and discusses every submission.\n\nWe look for designs with strong visual appeal that meet the criteria and are able to be feasibly built in a short time frame. We appreciate proposals that include well-crafted images that give us a good idea of the proposed concept.\n\nBecause we partner so closely with the lead artist, we’re especially interested in selecting someone whose values are aligned with our culture, who possesses a balance of leadership skills and humility, and who is motivated by offering a gift to the community.\n\nClick for caption details\n\nHow Does Burning Man Support the Temple?\n\nBurning Man Project supports the Temple each year with up to $100k in funding and up to $15k in resources such as decomposed granite, water, fuel and some heavy equipment.\n\nHow to Apply for the 2020 BRC Temple Grant\n\nBuilding the Black Rock City Temple is a significant undertaking. It’s also a chance to realize a dream and create a space for thousands of participants to have meaningful experiences.\n\nIf this sounds like you, the first step is reading this essay by John “Moze” Mosbaugh about the history and significance of the BRC Temple. Then, head on over to our BRC Temple Grant Page for the juicy details on available resources, what we are looking for in a successful proposal, and how to apply.\n\nThe online application form is now open, and all submissions need to be received by November 21, 2019, 5pm Pacific Time. Notifications will be sent to applicants by December 23, 2019.\n\nTop photo: Temple of Direction, 2019, by Geordie Van Der Bosch and the Temple Crew (Photo by Jamen Percy)",
