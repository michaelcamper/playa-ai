Part of my role includes spending time in different digital spaces, where I inevitably find myself admiring your myriad creations and projects. It’s inspiring to see so many of you out in your community creating events, fundraisers, art, podcasts, and more. We are dreamers, we are doers, and we love it.\n\nYet, while we’re undeniably talented and incredibly self-motivated, I’ve noticed that there’s one thing our community could use a little help with: promoting ourselves. I know, I know — it’s not the sexiest or most exciting topic, but it’s an important one for anyone with something to share. Why? Because without promotion, you’re creating in a vacuum; people can’t show up for you if they don’t know where, when, or how.\n\nSo this post is for any Burners out there who could use a crash course in digital self promotion — consider it a gift from all of us over here on the Communications team. You know, the kind of gift you didn’t ask for, but come to appreciate over time. Like a fresh pair of shoelaces, or a fancy, grown-up pen.\n\nAnd with that said, let’s get into it! *pushes glasses up nose*\n\nYou may be wondering: Can Burning Man Project’s Communications team help get the word out about your project?\n\nWell, lucky you — we’re starting something new for 2022! Every four to six weeks we’ll create a single community roundup post, called The Bullhorn, to offer a place for the Burning Man community to showcase their events, projects and other content on our Facebook page. We’ll kick it off each time with a few things we’ve heard around the burn barrel, but it’s up to you to make sure you add your own projects to the comments. It’s not only a great way for you to share your own creations, but also to find out what your fellow Burners are up to. Hooray!\n\nBut here’s the thing: this is just one piece of the puzzle. If you want to reach as many people as possible, we encourage you to promote on your own. So in the spirit of Radical Self-reliance, we’ve put together this list of tips to help educate and empower you to do outreach to the Burning Man community.\n\n1. Participate in Burning Man Hive!\n\nBurning Man Hive is a space for individuals inspired by Burning Man culture to learn, share, and connect. Within Hive, Burners can follow courses, connect around shared interests and projects, message one another, and cultivate collaborative friendships. Once you sign up using your Burner Profile (it’s free!), you’ll have access to a dedicated and interested set of individuals to engage with. You can learn from one another, share skills, and support each other’s projects out in the world.\n\n2. Connect With Your Local Regional Contact & Community\n\nAsk if your Regional Contact can add your project to their announcement email list (or other communication platform). Regional Contacts help local Burners connect with each other, while bringing Burning Man Principles and culture into their local communities through events and activities, year-round. Meanwhile, make time to connect with active and engaged Burners in your city or region — maybe some will even offer their time and talents to help out. Find and get in touch with your local Regional Contact here.\n\n3. Join and Get the Word Out on Relevant Facebook Groups\n\nJoin appropriate Facebook groups, engage with others there, and share your event/content. Believe it or not, you are likely to  have more interest and organic reach for your content in appropriate Facebook groups posting as yourself, than on Burning Man Project’s main channels (thanks, algorithm). The more engaged you are in these groups, the more people will engage with you! Here are a few popular groups for your consideration, but you should definitely do a search on your own for groups that are relevant to the event or project you’re creating. In particular, target your local Regional groups.\n\n4. Keep People Engaged by Creating and Posting in Facebook Events\n\nCreating Facebook Events is a great way to keep your event top of mind. If you’re creating a Facebook Event to share with your community, don’t just set it and forget it. Post relevant updates and entertaining details within the event — these will appear in the feeds of anyone who selected they’re “going” or “interested.”\n\n5. Submit Your Fundraiser to the ‘Support a Project’ Page\n\nIf you’re fundraising for your Burning Man art project that meets our criteria, we can list the project on the  Support a Project page, which we promote to the Burning Man community. Please note that this should not be your only solution for fundraising, but it’s a good place to start.\n\n6. Pitch or Write a Story for the Burning Man Journal\n\nFeeling extra passionate? Have a story to tell? Pitch (or better yet, write) an article for potential publication right here in the Burning Man Journal. If it’s not directly related to Burning Man, but aligns with the 10 Principles and our culture, we might consider your piece for inclusion on Burning Man Project’s channel on Medium, Beyond Burning Man. You can submit your idea by filling in the Share a Story form.\n\n7. List Your Project on Spark\n\nAre you looking for help on a specific project related to Black Rock City? List it on Spark! Spark is designed to facilitate connections and collaborations within the Burning Man Community, and provides a place for groups or individuals to post a listing for skill sets and/or resources they need or have to offer. Spark provides a secure place to make connections with other participants to help foster greater collaboration in efforts related to theme camps, art projects, mutant vehicles and other Burning Man related projects.\n\n8. Cultivate Your Community Year-round\n\nIf you are creating projects and events on a regular basis, it’s worth it to actively cultivate your audience and community year-round. Keep your presence on social media groups relevant and active by sparking conversations and bringing in members of the community who have ideas and want to contribute their time and resources. Build up your email list so you can reach out with relevant updates. Show appreciation for those who volunteer, and stay in touch throughout the year. Cultivate relationships with aligned global and local communities/projects that can support your project and wider community — keeping that momentum year round will make it immeasurably easier to activate, engage, and attract contributors and participants when you’re ready to get the word out about something new.\n\nSome Self-promotion Tips and Tricks!\n\nHuzzah, you did it!\n\nYou’ve made it to the end of this unexpected lesson in self promotion. It may not have been the hit of dopamine you were expecting, but hopefully you took something useful away from it. So get out there and start sharing all those amazing things you make — I can’t wait to see them on the interwebs.\n\n‘Tell Me Yours, I’ll Tell You Mine’ by Emma Shield, 2017 (Photo by Manual Pinto)",
