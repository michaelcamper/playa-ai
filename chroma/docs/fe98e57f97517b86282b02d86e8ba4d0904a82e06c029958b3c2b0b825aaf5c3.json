You’re not allowed to touch the art at the Louvre, never mind climbing on it, and the odds of meeting and conversing with the artists represented there are zero. (Really. They’re all dead.)\n\nDuring the last six months, the Burning Man Art Department’s staff and volunteers have prepared to present the largest outdoor art gallery in the world. Black Rock City has well over 150 million square feet of playa dedicated to art and an open invitation to interact with that art (eat your heart out, Mona Lisa!).\n\nWhoa, look at all this amazing artwork on the playa! Where do I even start?\n\nWe’re so glad you asked! Obviously, you can go where your spirit leads, the DIY approach, and we highly recommend picking up a handy-dandy Art Map that provides locations of nearly 80 artworks and short descriptions of each piece. You can get your copy at the ARTery, located at 6:30 and Esplanade.\n\nWhat if I want to know MORE? How can I learn the behind-the-scenes stories? Such as the inspiration behind the art? The artist’s vision? What these gargantuan pieces are made of, and how?\n\nFriend, you have come to the right place! Our specially trained guides have detailed information about each Honorarium artwork. They are also trained to lead discussions about the art! Note: Honoraria artworks are the pieces that have received partial funding from Burning Man Project.\n\nWhat, where, and when can I take an art tour with guides trained by the Burning Man Art department?\n\nThere are options for all BRC citizens to pARTicipate! Plan your art visit here, then look below for information on Art Speaks, BRC’s popular artist speaker series!\n\nArt Discovery Bicycle Tours – 2 hours\n\n10:00 am Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday\n\n7:00 pm Sunset Tours Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday\n\nBicycle tours cover one quarter of the inner playa and stop at a dozen or more art pieces to discuss the work in detail.\n\n🚲 👣 All bicycle tours start across the Esplanade from the ARTery, located at 6:30 and Esplanade. Look for the large pink and white sign.\n\nArt Discovery Walking Tours – 2 hours\n\n5:30 pm Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday\n\n🚲 👣 All walking tours start across the Esplanade from the ARTery, located at 6:30 and Esplanade. Look for the large pink and white sign.\n\nArt Discovery for Mobility-Challenged via Mutant Vehicle – 2 hours\n\n10:00am – 12:00 pm Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday\n\nEach tour covers half of the open playa. Come back another day to experience the other half of the playa! Everyone is welcome to participate, and those with mobility challenges get priority seating. These tours may include meet-ups with artists along the way.\n\n♿ All Mobility-Challenged tours leave from Mobility Camp located in the Center Camp Plaza and 1:45.\n\nArt Discovery for Deaf & Hearing Impaired via Mutant Vehicle – 2 hours\n\n10:00am – 12:00pm Wednesday & Thursday\n\nNew this year, these Mobility-challenged Art Discovery tours will feature ASL interpreters. Designed for participants who are deaf and/or mobility-impaired and their friends.\n\n🚂👂🏼Deaf & Hearing Impaired tours leave from Mobility Camp located in the Center Camp Plaza and 1:45.\n\nIf I want to hear directly from the artists while sitting down in a shady spot, do you have any recommendations?\n\nYou bet we do! It sounds like you’d enjoy…\n\nArt Speaks\n\n2:30pm – 4:00pm Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday\n\nCenter Camp, Speakeasy Stage\n\nThis is your chance to hear about the inspiration, challenges, mechanics and processes of creating art for the playa from a diverse selection of artists and artist teams.\n\nThe goal of Art Speaks is to gather an exciting mix of artists from both Honoraria and registered projects for a conversation about creating art for the playa. Some artists come from distant countries, while others are a few hours’ drive from home; some are well-known in the art world, and some have never before made a piece of art, let alone one of this magnitude.\n\nIn 2017, the ARTery hosted the inaugural edition of Art Speaks. That year, Burners got the chance to see and hear artists Jen Lewin, Peter Hazel, the Flaming Lotus Girls, Zachary Coffin, and Smithsonian Renwick Gallery Curator Nora Atkinson talk about their work and discuss with each other and the audience what it means to create art for Black Rock City. Each year since, the Art Department has invited a select group of artists to share their stories. Artists are Burning Man’s rock stars, but on the Art Speaks stage, each artist inevitably spends much of their time on the panel talking about the dozens of volunteers and hundreds of hours their teams put into the artwork.\n\nThis year, you’ll be able to hear from and interact with amazing artists at the Center Camp Speakeasy Stage from 2:30pm – 4:00pm, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\nHere’s the artist lineup for Art Speaks 2023:\n\nWednesday, 8/30\n\nThursday, 8/31\n\nFriday, 9/1",
