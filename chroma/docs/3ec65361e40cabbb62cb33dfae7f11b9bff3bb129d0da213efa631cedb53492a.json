  "content": "By Accuracy Third\n\nPresenting for your reference, Accuracy Third’s completely unsanctioned advice on the best ways to prepare for, acculturate for, survive, and enjoy Black Rock City. Whether you’ve been before or not, there’s a lot to learn — or at least disagree with — about the Accuracy Third crew’s opinions on how to do it right. We broke the Burning Man experience down into three parts: How Not to Fuck Up Going to Burning Man, How Not to Fuck Up Burning Man, and How to Un-fuck Your Burn. Absolutely all the things you need to know as far as we’re concerned!\n\nWritten, edited, and produced by: Accuracy Third\nParts 1 and 3 feature music by Midtown Social\nPart 2 features music by Vagabondage\n\nDon’t know what to pack for playa? Head on over to accuracythird.com to check out the Accuracy Third Packing List while you listen to our first season recounting the Burning Man Experience!\n\nEditor’s note: Hi, it’s Burning Man. Do you like listening to things? If so, it’ll please you to know that these and other aural pleasures are now available as a podcast for your enjoyment and edification while you’re packing, driving, or waiting in D Lot. In addition to SoundCloud, you can subscribe to the podcast via iTunes or RSS.\n\nAnd as if the Accuracy Third crew hadn’t done enough — between the Unofficial Audio Survival Guide and doing the editing for the amazing Coyote Nose stories — they’re letting us syndicate a couple starter episodes of their own show:",
