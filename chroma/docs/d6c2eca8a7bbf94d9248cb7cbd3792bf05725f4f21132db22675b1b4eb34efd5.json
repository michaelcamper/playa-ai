  "content": "AfrikaBurn 2013 — Burning Man’s official African regional Burn — is underway in Tankwa, South Africa. Now in its seventh year, AfrikaBurn is rightfully touted as “the spectacular result of the creative expression of a community of volunteers who, once a year, gather in the Tankwa Karoo to create a temporary city of art, theme camps, costume, music and performance!”\n\nThe event takes place May 1-6 on an expanse of remote desert in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa akin to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada (albeit a little more rocky), and its population has steadily grown since its inception … they’re expecting 8,000 participants this year.\n\nFounded and run under the guidelines of Burning Man’s 10 Principles, their mission statement states: “AfrikaBurn is a participant-created movement, an experiment in inclusive community building, decommodification, creativity, self-reliance and radical self-expression. It is a chance to invent the world anew.”\n\nA small contingent of intrepid Burning Man staffers have made the long journey to AfrikaBurn this year to observe, learn, share knowledge, and join in the revelry, and they’re sending some pictures and stories along, which we’ll add to this post as they arrive. Here’s BettieJune:\n\nAnd in a second dispatch:\n\nTo get a better sense of the experience, take a look at AfrikaBurn’s beautiful photo and video gallery.",
