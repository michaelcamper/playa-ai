  "content": "Now’s a good time for movement-building, and Adam Savage has an exciting announcement about an exciting initiative of which Burning Man is proud to be a part:\n\nNation of Makers is a new U.S. nonprofit formed to “serve and represent a wide variety of spaces, events, and institutions serving makers.” With coordination and support from an organization like this, far-flung makers and maker spaces can hopefully come together to revitalize this country’s economy and culture.\n\nBurning Man co-founder Harley Dubois is a founding board member of Nation of Makers, along with Pamela Jennings, Professor for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Winston-Salem State University, the aforementioned Adam Savage, head of Tested.com, and Stephanie Santoso, former White House Senior Advisor for Making. The fledgling organization already has Maker contacts at over 300 institutions in all 50 states.\n\n“Giving more Americans the opportunity to make, invent and create is critical to our future,” said Tom Kalil, Deputy Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in a press release. “Making can inspire more young people to excel in STEM education, promote entrepreneurship in manufacturing, and empower more people to solve problems in their communities.”\n\nDoesn’t that sound like something we could use more of right now?\n\nYou can find out more on the Nation of Makers website.\n\n(Top photo by Kay Morrison)",
