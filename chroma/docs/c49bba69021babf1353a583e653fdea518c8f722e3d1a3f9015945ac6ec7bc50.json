  "content": "We may not be building Black Rock City together this summer, but Burning Man is barreling full speed ahead, in full technicolor, and YOU are invited to get on board. Burners everywhere — just like you and your friends — are busy making art, planning wildly creative adventures, and doing helpful and good things. Of course you are; that’s what makes your dusty heart sing.\n\nAs you emerge into the world, we’re here to fire up your permission engine. We want to help open up the inherent possibilities that arise when you bring your most creative, inquisitive, most playful and resilient self into this very moment — and then invite your crew along for the ride.\n\nIntroducing 365: A Burning Man Field Guide — your manual for infusing Burner magic, whimsy, and kindness into your corner of the universe, right now. Dive into these beautifully illustrated pages to learn about Plugging into Burning Man Culture Virtually, Participating as a Burner in Your Home and Community, and Responsibly Visiting the Black Rock Desert.\n\nShare it with your friends!",
