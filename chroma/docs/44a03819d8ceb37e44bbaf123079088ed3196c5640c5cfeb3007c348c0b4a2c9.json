  "content": "Nina was a young San Franciscan Burner passionate about music, nature, human rights and education of all people. During her short life she composed beautiful, startling, personal and passionate music all while often traveling, engaging and interacting with people from around the world.\n\nIn the wake of the tragic and senseless murder which cut her life short at the age of 29, family and friends were committed to remembering Nina as the remarkable person she was, and to do it in a way that would make her proud. And so, the Nina Elizabeth Nilssen Scholarship Fund began in 2010 to support Nina’s love of the arts.\n\nNina’s fund has donated $1,000 to Sunset Piano to support a two-week event celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Botanical Gardens in San Francisco. The Burning Man Civic Arts Program is supporting the program with an additional $10,000.\n\nFrom July 9-20, the Botanical Garden inside Golden Gate Park will partner with Sunset Piano to bring 12 pianos and a host of amazing performers to its idyllic settings. During this time a number of amazing musicians will play, as well as leaving the pianos open for anyone to play. The installation will last 12 days and will have at least one or two special “concert” days when folks can wander between pianos and experience different kinds of music in different botanical settings.",
