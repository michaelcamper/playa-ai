  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is back with a third season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS03 E03 – It’s All About Cats & Nothing Else\n\nMeet the Ceiling Cat Prophet, Gulia, founder of the fastest growing religion on playa. One of the best acts of prayer possible. Some people that go to Burning Man belong in the Basement Cat’s Litter Box. The Order of Goats and Perpetual Shenaniganization of the Last Days. WTF is up with the Flying Spaghetti Monster? The pleasures of eating with Russian Burners, as well as the magic of Dust City Diner, Pink Mammoth Camp, Human Carcass Wash, Black Rock City Diner, and Skinny Kitty Camp. North West Mist has a mist system that really works, and the good word, which is, “Meow.” Also, fast-talkin’ 20s guys, Dickie in the box, and the time Rex won a thing.\n\nS03 E04 – Big White Fun\n\nPapa Witch and Pascal are two Burning Man volunteers. They are awesome people who just happen to be in the minority at Black Rock City. Pascal studies Russian. Papawitch has eight names. Pascal didn’t have a bicycle. If Morgan Freeman had dreadlocks. Papa Witch & Pascal A custom-ass experience for your pampered fat ass. Pascal’s last Burn for 10 years. Also, R-Evolution (not Bliss) should have stood on the National Mall. (Pictures of Pascal and Papa Witch by John Moyers Photography)\n\nAccuracy Third LIVE on May 5 in San Francisco!\n\nAccuracy Third is doing the thing that Accuracy Third does, but LIVE!
