  "content": "The Burning Man Earth team has created an iPhone Application to help rescue workers on the ground in Haiti as they help the country recover from the recent devastating earthquake.  Andrew Johnstone of the BME team wrote to Carmen Mauk of Burners Without Borders to tell her about it, as BWB teams are hard at work on the ground in Haiti.\n\nThe prospect of their future aspirations for this project depends on resources, volunteers, and money. If you’d like to help with forwarding this technology, email bmanearth (at) burningman (dot) com. Andrew writes:\n\n“Hi Carmen,\n\nJust to let you know that as soon as the Haiti quake hit, our main software developers for Burning Man Earth, Jeff Johnson and Mikel Maron, both got their sleeves rolled up and put together an interactive iPhone app with up-to-the-minute cartography for rescue workers on the ground. I am humbled that they are on our project and honored to call them friends.\n\nO’Reilly covered it here.  You can also find it by searching for “HaitiGPS” in the iTunes app store.\n\nThey got unprecedented cooperation from commercial satellite companies, the military, and Apple, and managed to get this off the ground in only a few days. This app is framed around GIA-GPS and if anything could focus attention that what we are doing for Black Rock City in making “cartography from chaos” having a real world application that will save lives… then this is it.\n\nThis [a serious natural disaster] WILL happen again. It may be San Francisco next time. Although we still have much work to do, we are within reach of our goal of the BME project being a fully-developed citywide geo network.\n\nBRC can be seen as a refugee camp for 50,000. It is a unique and perfect test ground for geo data response planning… harsh, off grid, temporary.\n\nWe have ultimate aspirations of a rugged and stand alone container pod of solutions. Deployed into a disaster area, a ring of self-powered antennas maintain a small WIFI cloud of several square miles allowing anyone with a laptop or smartphone to access up to the minute cartography and aerial shots overlayed by GPS-augmented data (making any from far away, a local). For those without access to phones and computers, local “flat pack hexayurt” kiosks provide “playa info” type services for those seeking or leaving information. The container itself provides a home for the base station housing the server and tech crew.\n\nAfter a disaster, we could be up and running within hours of getting on site and basic instructions for how to find and use the application could be broadcast on the radio, and they are invited to join the geo wiki.\n\nWho/where are you?\nWho/what are you trying to find?\nWhat do you need?\nWhat have you to offer?\nRumor free information.\n\nThe events of the past week have sharpened my time line. This is needed now, and hesitation may be measured in lives lost.\n\nThanks for all the work you do,\n\nAndrew Johnstone\nProject Lead\nBurning Man Earth”",
