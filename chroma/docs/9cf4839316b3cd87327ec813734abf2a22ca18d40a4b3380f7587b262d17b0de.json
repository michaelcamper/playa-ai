  "content": "Just before last year’s Black Rock City event, we announced our plans to bring a new kind of convening to life — a gathering of more than 2,000 innovators, leaders, doers, activists, social change makers from across the Burning Man community and beyond — in Reno in the spring of this year.\n\nSince then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of interest in this event. We are excited and inspired by the passion, ideas, and contributions pouring out of this community. While we have past experience hosting gatherings such as the Global Leadership Conference, the European Leadership Summit, and the Theme Camp Symposium, and have cheered on the continuing growth of the Regional Network and Locally Organized Leadership Gatherings, the potential for this new event is even larger and more important than we could have predicted.\n\nWe’ve come to understand that with some additional time for planning and for incorporating your great ideas, we can make this convening truly successful and effective in bringing people together to connect, share, and catalyze lasting cultural change.\n\nTo that end, we have decided to launch this event in 2021. Taking more time will allow us to produce more valuable content, more pathways for community development, and more fully-developed tools for connecting and collaborating beyond the event itself. The results during and after this convening promise to be stronger and more productive. If you want to stay informed and hear the latest as this evolves, please sign up for our mailing list here.\n\nThanks so much for being on this journey with us. We’re excited to see what we can do together and look forward to sharing updates with you soon.\n\nTop photo by Burning Man Documentation Team",
