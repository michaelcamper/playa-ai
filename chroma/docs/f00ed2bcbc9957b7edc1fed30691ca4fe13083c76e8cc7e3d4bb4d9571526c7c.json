  "content": "If you haven’t already participated in the 2017 Black Rock City Census online survey, you’re about to run out of time! The survey will close at the end of the day on October 22. You may have been randomly sampled on your way in the Gate; you may have filled out a Field Notes book at Census Lab or Center Camp; you may have started the online form, but quit a few minutes in. If any of those are you, you’re not done! If you want to stand up and be counted, now’s the time. But why should you?\n\nIf you’ve already done it and we’re preaching to the choir, thanks for your data and for reading our list! If not, then what are you waiting for? Go do it!\n\nWritten by Sarah “Picky” Williamson\n\nEdited by Dana “DV8” DeVaul",
