  "content": "This year’s Burning Man theme, “Carnival of Mirrors,” seems to be continuing in the default world, with some not-so-pretty funhouse mirrors clanging and shattering against each other every time non-understanders-of-the-dirt-rave make a dissonant mainstream commercial exploitation device or hone in on rich people and two-day bug infestations in the desert. Instead of maybe talking about how a temporary city for over 70,000 people appears and disappears each year with precision and grace.\n\nHowever, those of us still cleaning up the desert out here haven’t borne the full brunt of the squares’ warped notions of Burning Man. We’re still away from mass media and mainstream life, safe and sound in the Resto bubble.\n\nWe in the Department of Public Works are still riding high on the like-clockworkness of this season’s staging and strike — and still happy to be rolling around the desert as roustabouts in our very own circus sideshow. We are all carnival and circus fetishists here, to some degree. For many of us, life and work are the same thing, to be ridden like a … well, like a carnival ride.\n\nWouldn’t you know it, Burning Man’s — and the Cacophony Society‘s — dang paterfamilias Gary Warne once wrote himself an infamous essay about just such a concept. We’re posting it in full, because it needs to live on the Burning Man site and we can’t believe it doesn’t already.\n\nNever heard of Gary Warne, have you? Tragically, he died suddenly at age 35 in 1983, but not before leaving a huge scorchmark on the earth. It’s no understatement to say we are all still playing in his smoke and ash.\n\nGary Warne founded the Suicide Club with four other people in 1977, while he was teaching classes on pranks and hijinks as part of the budding “free-school” movement at UCSF’s Communiversity.\n\nThe proto-punk Suicide Club morphed a few years later into the Cacophony Society, “a randomly gathered network of free spirits united in the pursuit of experiences beyond the pale of mainstream society.”\n\nEarly Cacophonists were the ones who invented Burning Man, after 89 people took one of Cacophony’s newly-notorious Zone Trips out to the Black Rock Desert in 1990, inviting Larry Harvey and Jerry James to bring along their wooden statue the cops wouldn’t let them burn at Baker Beach.\n\n“Carnival Cosmology” stands as one of the two founding documents of the Cacophony Society, along with Hakim Bey’s Temporary Autonomous Zone. It’s the only essay printed, in full, in not one but two core Cacophony books — Chicken John’s The Book of the Is and Galbraith/Evans/Law’s Tales of the SF Cacophony Society.\n\nGary Warne is literally the first Tyler Durden, the original, the maverick who inspired the other mavericks who inspired the book Fight Club. Basically, Gary Warne is the person who devised and/or pioneered flash mobs, urban exploration, urban games, billboard liberation, the Chinese New Year’s Treasure Hunt, the Dashiell Hammett walking tour of SF, free schools, and other cultural phenomenae we now take for granted as having always existed.\n\nIt can all be traced back to San Francisco, as usual, to some freak who was inspired by his insipid upbringing in squaresville to change the world through bold and unproven social experiments in sovereignty, free thought, and not-taking-life-so-seriously.\n\nand now, the essay that birthed project mayhem:\n\nRelated posts by this writer:\nEarly Man: Proto-DPW\nEarly Man-Man: proto-Burnin’ Dude builders and inspirational catalysts\nJohn Law and Last Gasp announce Cacophony Society history book\nHow the Fence Began\nTyler Durden Invented Burning Man\n\n*\n\nFollow Summer Burkes on Twitter.",
