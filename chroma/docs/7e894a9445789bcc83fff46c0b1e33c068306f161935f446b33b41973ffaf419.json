  "content": "There is an art to the art of Burning Man, a coherent whole designed by many participants, doers, makers, artists, and contributors. At the center of the city is the one artwork created by Burning Man Project: the Man itself.\n\nOver the years, Larry Harvey would collaborate with many, including Andrew Johnstone, Jack Haye, and Stuart Mangrum, to inspire and guide the shaping of the Man and the outward expression of the theme at the Man base (sometimes called the Man Pavilion). Often anyone who encountered Larry was likely to see sketches, hear stories, and learn details of his vision for the Man and how it would be activated.\n\nFew of us know all the players and partners who have worked alongside Larry; there are the builders, the draftspeople, and the participants — many hands making the work an act of grace, giving, and participation in the eventual experience of the art and the Man in Black Rock City.\n\nThis year, with the loss of Larry, we invited some artists and designers to sketch their ideas for what the Man base could be. In this manner we could be inclusive and share the opportunity to imagine the Man base with artists and architects within our community.\n\nAfter selecting the design sketch, it fell to us to develop the construction plans, and to imagine the artist elements that would be integrated into the experience at the base of the Man. The evolving visual landscape for the Man base, the legs, and the chrysalis is truly remarkable — and the art integration is equally exciting.\n\nThis year, our call was for aerial artists, civic design plazas, and a specific commission for the centerpiece at the location of the Golden Spike. We can now announce the artists who will be offering their own special expression to the Man this year, in three parts:\n\nThe Centerpiece will be designed and created by David Best, who has imagined it as a hexagonal banquette with a diorama at the center. People will be able to sit and take in the surroundings while being enveloped in the creative vision of small vignettes that reflect the metamorphoses of a variety of insects, capped by an abstracted sense of plant life that emerges from the center.\n\nOur Civic Design Challenge resulted in some beautiful variations on gathering spaces in our central plaza.\n\nOn the 12 o’clock side of the Man, we will feature the work of artist Kelly Smith Cassidy and her piece, E Pluribus Unum: Out of One, Many, which will invite seating, socializing, and people-watching.\n\nOn the 3 o’clock side, we will feature artist Benjamin Rowe with his Small Community Shelters, which will have delightful moments of canopy and shade designed for hanging out and taking in the view.\n\nFinally, on the 9 o’clock side the Man Pavilion Build Crew will add their own contribution to the sense of place at the center of Black Rock City.\n\nAnd then we have Aerial Artists! We’ve selected 26 artists — some troupes, some small ensembles, and several soloists. Each day, Monday through Friday, at 10am and 10pm for one hour there will be incredible artistry, explorative performances and interesting new apparati suspended from beneath the legs of the Man base.\n\nThere will be so many variations of aerial exploration that every moment will be a visual delight not to be missed. Here is the list of artists you can look forward to seeing:\n\nOn the whole, the art of Burning Man promises to be transcendent this year: it will effervesce, it will invite play, it will transport and lift through the air, and it will be memorable. We will all find moments of awe, delight, wonder, and even some quiet as we navigate the paths of chance and Metamorphoses on our own journeys through the Black Rock Desert.\n\nTop photo: E Pluribus Unum: Out of One, Many",
