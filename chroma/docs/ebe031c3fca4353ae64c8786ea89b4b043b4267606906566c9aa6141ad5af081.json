  "content": "Burning Man is excited to announce the launch of Burner Profiles, a system to help facilitate the flow of information we regularly collect from Burning Man participants for ticket sales, theme camp and art installation registration, mutant vehicle applications, What Where When submissions, and other things that people do and create for Black Rock City.\n\nInitially, the Burner Profile will be used as part of the pre-registration process for ticket sales to Burning Man 2013. To create your profile and pre-register for access to ticket sales, the only information you’re required to provide is your first name, last name, email address, and mailing address. That’s it … the same info required whenever you buy Burning Man tickets.\n\nEventually we’ll be expanding the use of this new platform to offer additional features. So, the more information you put into your profile, the more value you’ll get out of it. Those of you involved with creating (and registering) projects for Burning Man are quite familiar with the wealth of information we collect year after year in order to process your registrations, and we want to make that whole process easier for YOU and for US by storing information in your Burner Profile.\n\nAnd in the glorious vision of our future, we believe Burner Profiles will help facilitate communications regarding on-playa and off-playa volunteer activities, give us the ability to provide communications that are pertinent to you, and offer consolidated access to all of the Burning Man information systems that you work with.\n\nIf none of that stuff pertains to you, though, and you just like to come out to the playa and quietly do your thing, that’s fine … you can include as much information as you wish, or as little as you’d like. It’s totally up to you.\n\nYour information will be private and will not be shared — nor will it be searchable on the internet. (For more details see our Privacy Policy.)\n\nWe’ve long dreamed of having this kind of system in place in order to simplify and streamline our processes. We’re pretty certain it will make your overall Burning Man experience smoother and more enjoyable, and provide you with a nice reflection of your role in creating Burning Man culture at the same time.\n\n(Oh and for those of you who filled out the Pink Postcard when you came into Black Rock City last year, thank you! That was the pilot program the Burner Profile system.)",
