This celestial moment marks the day we honor Burning Man’s inception 37 years ago — the first time Larry Harvey, Jerry James, their kids, and friends built and burned a wooden Man on Baker Beach.\n\nBurning a human effigy, and celebrating the solstice on a beach gathering are not revolutionary acts unto themselves; humanity has created these moments and imbued them with meaning since before recorded history. But the impetus that brought these two acts together ignited something new (and also ancient) in those early Burners. Maybe it soothed unmet desires for ritual, communion and continuity at a time when people were feeling increasingly disconnected.\n\nBy 1990, the original crew merged with the Cacophony Society and other instigators, and engineered a leap from beach to desert. Before long Burners were building massive fiery art and other wonders, organizing theme camps, erecting a Temple, and piloting wildly illuminated mutant vehicles.\n\nIn short, we had a city. And then we had a global community — Burners around the world made the 10 Principles their own, launching Regional Events and local Burning Man communities.\n\nSo, happy solstice to you. We hope you make time to commemorate this moment in whatever way is meaningful. Perhaps take a gander at our 365 Field Guide for tips on bringing Burning Man into your corner of the universe — on the solstice or any time. Around here today, we pause to remember Larry Harvey, our original instigator. He was a prolific reader and writer; his words are foundational to how Burning Man emerged as a global culture and community.\n\nLearn More About Larry Harvey, the History of Burning Man, and Our Connection with the Solstice:\n\nRead Previous Years’ Solstice Posts:",
