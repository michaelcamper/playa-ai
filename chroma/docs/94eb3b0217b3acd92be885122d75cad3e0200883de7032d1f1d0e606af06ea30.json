  "content": "If you have a story, an image, or anything to share from Friday or Saturday at the Temple this year, we want to see it.\n\nMy friend Sarah and I are working on a project that covers the span of time from midday Friday to midday Saturday at the Temple of Juno. That encompasses at least five weddings, the gnarliest dust storm of the week, and many more emotional highs and lows.\n\nWere you there? Send your memories to us {at} templestories.com. Make them as long or as short as they need to be. Please include names to go with your stories, though the names can be whatever you want.\n\nPlease only share information you’re willing to share publicly online.\n\nYou’ll hear more about this project very soon.\n\nWe love you,\nJon & Sarah\n\nThanks forever to Scott London for the photo.",
