  "content": "Before there’s the Man, before there’s a Center Camp and before the first sound system is powered up, there are the trucks.\n\nAll day long on Friday, 08/08/08, trucks came from the ranch and from points further away loaded with the gear that will make Black Rock City. Semi-trailers made their way back and forth from the staging area at the 200-acre Burning Man ranch several miles down the road from the playa.\n\nTo get an idea of just how big this operation is, Maid Marian told me there are 61 containers stored at the site, along with 45 travel trailers and about 30 semi trailers. “Transpo” day is really two days long, and four semis and a bunch of smaller trucks and haulers operate 10 hours a day to get it all  out to the playa.\n\nYou walk down the rows and rows of containers and see the familiar names — Here’s all the stuff for Artica; here’s Michael Michael’s gear; here’s everything for Recycle Camp; here’s the Bike Guild containers … it goes on and on.\n\nAnd standing stoically at the gate to the yard, Corey keeps a clipboard and checks off everything as it leaves the yard. “Pretty damn exciting, huh?” he asks sardonically.  … Well, exciting may not be the exact right word, but “amazing” comes close.\n\nBurning Man, where you can act as spontaneously as you want to for a week at the end of August, is anything but spontaneous before and after the Burn. It’s choreographed chaos that results in a city in the middle of the desert.",
