  "content": "We might like to dream about Black Rock City existing all alone on some moon of Jupiter or something, but that dream is always temporarily dispelled on the way in and on the way out. There’s a gate. There’s a perimeter. It’s an enclosed, defined space. That space — as well as the massive ritual of entering and exiting it — is created and managed by the Gate, Perimeter & Exodus (GP&E) Team.\n\nGetting into and out of Black Rock City is no mean feat — nor is managing that process safely and effectively. Easeful entry and exit requires your help and cooperation. The experience is emotional for all of us, and there are many mysteries and questions. In this video, Ira Wing from Gate, Perimeter & Exodus will take you on a tour of everything involved in getting BRC’s humans and their vehicles in and out.",
