  "content": "As a Burner, you would think that I would love the Xmas season.\n\nIt’s the time of year when normally modest streets turn into suburban Esplanades – with glowing plastic reindeer and gaudy strings of lights everywhere.\n\nWe even have a obsessive cultural focus on Gifting during the holidays.\n\nFar surpassing eggnog, mistletoe or jingle bells, the importance of gift giving dominates the Xmas season.\n\nThis makes sense because the entire economy depends on end-of-the-year spending. The Dow Jones could care less about the rise and fall of snowmen or the number of carols sang per capita.\n\nBut a cultural frenzy of spending? That is important. And the barrage of lights, music, and advertising are all going to make sure you don’t forget.\n\nThis seems like it should be a good thing. Gifting is one of the 10 Principles – so wouldn’t a cultural focus on gift giving be a good thing?\n\nUnfortunately, there is something about Gifting that has been lost in our modern practice of holiday cheer.\n\nLet’s review what a gift is.\n\nA gift is something given without expectation. It is an opportunity for the giver and the receiver to both receive pleasure.\n\nOne feels good about what they received. The other feels good that they have done something kind.\n\nThis does not happen in a transactional exchange.\n\nIf I go to the store and pay the cashier for a serving of figgy pudding, then I expect to receive it. I have traded something of comparable value for that item. In math terms, the sum value is zero.\n\nBut if you come to my house and GIFT me that pudding, I did not expect it. I am delighted by it. I get joy from it. And I do not have to give anything to get it. The sum of that exchange is +1.   If you feel joy from seeing me happier, then your experience is an additional +1.\n\nA traditional, transactional exchange has an energetic equation of sum zero. But a gift results in plus two!\n\n(If you come to my house and demand figgy pudding while singing songs, that is something else entirely.)\n\nFrom this understanding, you start to notice that many scenarios that seem like they should be gifting, are actually transactions.\n\nFor example, you may have had an unfulfilling experience with a panhandler on the street.\n\nHe has a sign asking for change. You, being a kind person, give him some money. He says “Thank You,” but for whatever reason, you don’t feel all-that-great about your gifting. Why?\n\nI would argue that this was actually a transaction. The panhandler is expecting money. By you giving it, you are not adding anything to his day, you are simply giving what he is asking for. (I am not commenting on whether he needs or deserves the money…just on why it doesn’t feel so good.)\n\nIn some ways what he is selling is an opportunity to ease your guilt.\n\nI find it MUCH more satisfying to give to someone in need who isn’t overtly asking. I.e. I see someone dirty with a sleeping bag, “Hey, have you had breakfast, yet? Grab something on me.” In that scenario there is no exchange or transaction.\n(If you want to tell me why you should never give money to homeless, you can save it. That is a debate for a different day.)\n\nA similar thing happened when we institutionalized the holiday gifting tradition.\n\nThe whole concept of a “Gift Exchange” is a bit of a misnomer.\n\nIf I have to give you a gift, then that is not a gift. It is a transaction.\n\nSure, there can still be joy involved in expected gift giving. Like, when you put deep thought into a gift. Or if the item is deeply desired.   But it lacks all the magic of true Gifting.\n\nCompare the scenario of bringing home flowers on a random day vs. bringing home flowers on Valentine’s Day. Which one is more touching?   (And if you have never given flowers to your partner for no reason, I suggest you do so TODAY.) If flowers are expected and you bring flowers, you are falling into a +1/-1 =sum zero equation.\n\nSadly, much of the holiday season has slipped into this transactional realm. You may be one of the rare people that loves the opportunity to shop and spend for every loved one and professionally-appropriate recipient. But for the rest of us, the holiday gift list just means we’ve added the hassle of a second part-time job. The obligation of shopping is just too much.\n\nI’m not saying we shouldn’t exchange gifts. Let’s just try to reframe our perspectives so we can return to a joyful gift giving experience.\n\nIf I am instructed to give someone a gift card to Best Buy, how am I able to enjoy that experience? It feels almost like panhandling wrapped in tinsel and mistletoe.\n\nAnd if someone shares their Amazon wish list, it makes gifting about as joyful as re-ordering office supplies.\n\nThere may be exceptions. Maybe your cousin is preparing for a trip to Peru and asked everyone for REI gift certificates.\n\nMaybe your spouse is starting a new hobby of miniature train-building and sent direct links to make sure you knew the right scale of accessories to shop for.\n\nThe point is that we need to remember what Gifting is so that we can rescue the season from the clutches of commercialism.\n\nGifting can be a demonstration of Love.\n\nIt can be a tool of connection.\n\nWhen I give to you freely, I am recognizing that we are connected. And when I receive joy from your joy, I am experiencing a form of unconditional love.\n\nIn fact, I often use the example of Xmas morning as a perfect example of Gifting. When a child tears open a gift and squeals in joy, they experience a plus 1. When you get joy from seeing them so happy, YOU experience a plus 1.\n\nBut that isn’t always what happens on Xmas morning. Too often you see a kid tear open a gift only to see their angry little face exclaim, “This isn’t the one I wanted!”\n\nUnfortunately, this is what can happen when Gifting becomes transactional.   A receiver has a value expectation of the exchange and too easily feels like cheated customer – instead a delighted loved one.\n\nWhen the Buddha talked about the suffering caused by attachment to outcome, he may have been talking about Lego sets on Xmas morning.\n\nThe key is to re-set and eliminate expectations so that every interaction can be enjoyed as a gift.\n\nThis same exercise is important on the Playa.\n\nOccasionally we experience this at my camp during our annual Vegan Ice Cream Social. People will wait in line and have an expectation that sours the experience.\n\nToo many times I’ve seen someone handed an ice cream cone just to have them jerk their hand away and curtly say, “I don’t want that flavor.”\n\nEvery heard the phrase “don’t look a gift horse in the mouth?” Yeah, that is a terrible expression. But it does kill the gifting magic when you are overly critical of a gift. Learning to be a good receiver is soooo important.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with preferring chocolate. But let me offer a suggested way to express the sentiment while still remembering that this is a gifting experience: “Thank you! I’m actually a huge chocolate lover. Would it be a hassle to get a chocolate one? Then I (or you) can gift this to someone else?”\n\nThen, no matter what the answer is, “Thank you for bringing ice cream to the desert!”\n\nThe graduate level practice of this is to remove the transactional expectation from things that actually are transactional.\n\n“Wow! Thank you for bagging all my groceries up!”\n\n“Why, yes, I would like a refill on root beer. That is so nice of you!”\n\n“It is my turn and you are going to let me merge? Awww! Thank you!”\n\nSuddenly the world is filled with abundance and you are the recipient of constant treasures.\n\nSo, good luck this holiday season! May you demonstrate the magic of true Gifting and experience Christmas miracles every day.",
