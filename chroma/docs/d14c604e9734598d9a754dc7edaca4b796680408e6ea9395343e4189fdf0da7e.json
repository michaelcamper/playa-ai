  "content": "It’s a little hard, and maybe a little humbling, to realize how much talent there is in Black Rock City.\n\nTo be here, you pretty much have to be able to weld or build or do the electric or do the plumbing. Builders with skill sets are what’s needed most.\n\nAnd that’s how it should be, of course, but it doesn’t end there. Not at all.\n\nThere was a little gathering at the Heavy Machinery yard last night, and it was another reminder of just how varied and well-rounded the people here are.\n\nDylan was there with his accordion, and PigPen from Center Camp was on the bass. Various members of the Titanium Sporkestra were there too, playing guitar and the washboard and more. Gary, the crane operator, was keeping time on the bongos.\n\nIt was all relatively low key by playa standards, although the drinking songs were raucous. But at the end of another long day, under a mostly full moon, and lubricated by the generosity of the folks at Heavy Equipment, you couldn’t really ask for more.\n\nThe singing and the partying was a reminder of what’s to come. Everyone’s working hard here, but they know a big party’s coming —  your party.",
