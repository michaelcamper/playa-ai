  "content": "From the moment I could read, I’ve been drawn to fantasy tales starring female heroines. Each time the heroine uncovers the magical destiny awaiting her, my heart races in excitement for the adventure ahead.\n\nI never anticipated my own life following a similar path, but since finding Home at my first Burn in 2014, my life has been filled with transformation, magic and creativity. I launched my own wardrobe-styling business, wrote my first novel (now in the process of publication), and am now writing a memoir about my experiences as a black femme Burner. I’m driven to invite others to expand their lives and reality the way I feel each Burn does for me.\n\nLast year, in addition to my fifth Burn, I attended an expedition at Fly Ranch. I had no idea what to expect but was excited to explore this remote land.\n\nI’m a city mouse and had never been to such a beautifully wild place. The geyser, wild horses and hot springs featuring Milky Way views transported my whole being to another plane. Overwhelmed by peace, I found my brain flowing with inspiration. I had to ask for an additional notebook to hold my thoughts.\n\nOn our final day, the Fly Ranch Team said they want the property to be fertile ground for whatever could be created there, and asked for our program suggestions. I was one of a handful of people of color at that weekend. I felt my ancestors guiding me in what I did and said next.\n\n“Women of color are at a disadvantage for opportunities in the publishing or writing retreat world. I feel so inspired to create by being here and this has been such a gift for me as a writer. It would be wonderful if this land could be a safe space for the people who need it the most, women of color, to find their voices and create the stories that so need to be shared,” I said to the Fly Ranch team and 50 + attendees.\n\nI remember shaking after all the words came out of me, afraid I was asking too much. Is Fly Ranch even open to servicing the needs of people of color? Does this kind of event align with the Fly Ranch vision?\n\nSince that nervous ‘dream on a limb’ moment, I have been overwhelmingly impressed by Matt Sundquist, Zac Cirivello and the Fly Ranch Team. First, they welcomed me to speak on a panel at the 2018 Burn and share my outspoken views on inclusivity.\n\nAnd then, the team suggested I submit a proposal. After talking with the Fly Ranch Working Group, we’re moving forward with a writing expedition for women and non-binary writers of color. Oh yeah! It’s happening, fam!\n\nSo, the expedition is titled “Writers Emerging @ Fly Ranch”. Matt and I, along with an exceptional advisory team, are planning to bring around 60 women and non-binary writers of color to the Fly Ranch property for five days this fall (tentative dates are October 15–20).\n\nThe expedition will serve as a writing incubator, nurturing emerging writers over 18 and helping generate fresh writing and direction. Participants will learn about the writing craft and publishing industry through workshops and mentoring by a team of qualified writing coaches. Most importantly, they will have the experience of connecting to self and disconnecting from society while creating art in nature.\n\nOne of the expedition’s goals is to create a place for discovering the strength to say, ‘I am a writer’. Achieving the internal evolution necessary to feel confident that you create art that should be shared is a real challenge.\n\nThis internal click of creative self esteem took me decades to find. But once I claimed it, my life transformed as I saw that my art is medicine for others. This event is being shaped with the intention to help participants find their voices, as it is brave voices that will help heal and shape our future.\n\nMatt and I have dreamed of this being a minimal cost experience for the participants with as little barriers as possible to those who need this opportunity. To find out more and stay in touch about final dates and plans for the workshop, sign up to the Fly Ranch newsletter.\n\nIn the meantime, we are also seeking support from the community to run this Burning Man event, which is inspired by the 10 Principles. We’ll be creating the event with Communal Effort, Participation, Leaving No Trace and Radical Self-Reliance. Let us know if you would like to be a Ranger for the event, organize a kitchen, help with set up and strike, or support the programming. To register your support, please follow this link.\n\nWe are looking forward to sharing a curated experience that will invite writers to leave reality and shift towards the fantasy of who they want to become.\n\nFinally, I hope ‘Writers Emerging’ is just the first of many creative gatherings held at Fly Ranch. One of the goals for this expedition is to draft a template for future events. The team will be documenting our approach and updating the model for convenings on the property so other community members can propose and host events.\n\nFly Ranch is a breathtaking space brimming with possibilities of new creations and transformation. I’m excited that this experience can serve as a pilot for future creative gatherings at Fly Ranch, benefitting new and seasoned members of the Burning Man community.\n\nTo learn more about the space, visit the Fly Ranch website.",
