  "content": "Hey Bay Area artists: so, why aren’t you building that giant steel sculpture you’re always talking about? Oh, because you need steel? Well, as you know, the original Bay Bridge is being dismantled, and the Oakland Museum of California has launched a program to pair artists with its steel.\n\nApplications for use of the reclaimed steel are due October 1, 2015, and priority will be given to public art or civic projects, and to projects that reference the original bridge’s historical importance.\n\nVisit the Oakland Museum of California’s website for more information on how to apply. Good luck!",
