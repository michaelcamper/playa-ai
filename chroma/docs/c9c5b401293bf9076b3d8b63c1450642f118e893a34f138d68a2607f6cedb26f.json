  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast just wrapped up its second season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS02 E15 – Burning Man is for Amateurs\n\nIn our season finale, we talk to the God Box brigade, Darakshan, Miles and Yay, about what the phone booth known as Talk to God Box is all about. Get ready for (in no particular order) Japanese God, Little-Girl God, Take-No-Shit God, the God of Unconditional Love, the God of Gay Marriage, and the God in the Box. The God malfunction, the ballad of Tasty Pickle, the Talk to Bog Bog concept is coming soon, and a DPW receives a gift from God. Also, The World’s Best Knock-Knock joke.\n\nUnofficial Burning Man Survival Guide 2017 Update: The Laws Have Changed\n\nA quick update from D-Day, Rex, and D-Beth about how Nevada’s laws are not federal laws, and how you’re going to have to deal with both on your way to playa. Also, a little gift we like to call “mouth noise galore.”\n\nVirgin Acculturation Guide\n\nPassing on the culture of Black Rock City to Burning Man virgins can be a fraught process. You remember being invited to this awesome party and then being told ad nauseam how to act right, right? Right. So to save you the hassle of sounding like a pedantic, know-it-all culture-jerk, the Accuracy Third Podcast has collected a cornucopia of voices to give your Burning Virgins a taste of what they’re getting into, culturally. If you’re looking for something with more of a how-do-I-survive flavor, we made an Unofficial Burning Man Survival Guide last year, which you can find at our website or wherever you get your podcasts. See you at the Burn, Birgins!\n\nResources\n\nAdvice about relationship communication\nA huge trove of handy Burning Man advice\nWrite a letter to a virgin, or receive one\nThe classic text Temporary Autonomous Zone by Hakim Bey\n\nAccuracy Third needs your help! If you like what we’re doing, please subscribe to our podcast and rate us in iTunes, the Google Play store, or Stitcher. Help us tell their algorithms to smush our voices into as many ears as possible. Together, we can tell the world what we’re doing at that thing in the desert!",
