This is an open, passionate invitation to activate and celebrate the ethos of Burning Man in your year-round community. A few things are already popping up (we’ll be updating this list as new items come in):\n\nNot sure what to do? Plan a work of art to beautify a local space. Get a group of friends together to clean up a nearby beach. Volunteer at a local food bank or homeless shelter. Visit a senior center or see if a youth group needs help. Get inspired by past Burners Without Borders community projects from the Global Wave of Service, or check out BWB’s handy dandy tool-kit for kickstarting civic projects. Whatever you do, feel free to make it fun and self-expressive!\n\nShare what you’re up to in this Facebook event, on Instagram, and on Twitter! Tag your posts, photos, videos, thoughts and more with #thankslarry, #leaveapositivetrace and/or #burningsolstice so we can find and share your content, particularly on Instagram Stories. We’ll be sharing your content over the weekend.\n\nLet’s join together for a weekend of Civic Responsibility, Participation, and Communal Effort. Bring Burning Man to the world around you!\n\nTop photo by Mark Mennie",
