  "content": "At the 2011 Burn, a small group of talented video producers and friends got generous. As part of a public relations gift initiative, they undertook to produce video treatments of selected art projects. The idea was to give Burning Man artists the benefit of what Media Team members do well, and to give the artists new tools to promote their work, their teams and their dreams.\n\nThe videos on this blog have all been gifted to the artists, and are being simultaneously made available to you. They are an example of how unexpected generosity serves new friends in original ways, just as it serves art in new ways. These “Profiles in Dust” are a gift from the Burning Man Media Team to all artists and Burners, whether depicted in this collection of films or not.\n\nWe encourage you to share these videos with your friends, family, and others who are interested in Burning Man. It’s truly amazing what happens when talent and inspiration unite with the spirit of gifting.\n\nWe look forward to exploring the artwork on the playa in 2012.  And, without further ado, we present you with the “Profiles in Dust.”\n\n“Profiles in Dust” Crew:\n\nJustin Gunn—Supervising Producer/ Editor\nTerry Pratt—Producer/ Director of Photography\nGregory Sklar—Co-Executive Producer, Management & Logistics\nMichael Fasman—Producer\nTom Greene—Producer\nNoelle Charles—Producer\nChristopher Breedlove—Producer\nMike Hedge—Additional Camera\nBen Page—GoPro Cameraman\nTimothy Palmer—Motion Graphics Design\nRobert Gibbs—Logistics and Artist Relations\nColin “Donkeyboy” Creveling—Graphic Design\nAtom Smith—Music\nShpongle—Music\nTranscenders—Music\nTom LaPorte—Executive Producer\nMeghan Rutigliano—Executive Producer\nJim Graham—Public Relations Advisor",
