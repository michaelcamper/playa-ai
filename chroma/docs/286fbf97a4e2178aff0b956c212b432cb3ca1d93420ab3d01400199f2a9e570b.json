Now that we are not building Black Rock City 2020, we have a once-in-a-lifetime (we hope) chance to truly fulfil this year’s intended theme: Multiverse, the multiple, neverending number of realities. We can make it more real than we would have ever imagined!\n\nWhat better way to do this than to create our Home Away From Home at Home. Yes exactly! Let’s create our version of BRC in our home, and share the vision of this creation with the world.\n\nIs it going to be a statue, painting, sticker, story, video, costume, pottery, meal, drink, performance, photograph, poem? Well, I don’t know, and I am curious for you to show me! I will be creating my BRC — Multiverse 645-60 (yup, I just claimed this number; you can claim yours) in an old suitcase, which served as a mini traveling educational installation about Burning Man for many years.\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nI invite you to join me in creating a BRC Multiverse of endless possibilities! Take your time! Take good care of yourself, your loved ones and others. Do what you need to do right now to make sense of our new reality.\n\nThis is also a time when many Burners are busy showing the world we are more than just a party in the desert or at a Regional Event. They are creating civic projects, inventions, innovations, and brilliant art to keep people entertained, sane, and, most importantly, alive.\n\nThis all deserves our energy and resources. But while we understand the importance of our skills and ideas for our families, communities and the world right now, it does not diminish the fact that many of us will miss BRC terribly this year.\n\nI know I will, as BRC is truly my Home away from Home, where I meet my chosen family.  Many of them I can only meet there. I was not ready to miss BRC 2020 when my country — the Czech Republic — and pretty much the whole of Europe shut down.\n\nI started to realize this year’s journey to the dust would not be happening for many international Burners like me, and the idea of creating a mini BRC was helping me make peace with that inevitable reality.\n\nThe project was also intended for other people who couldn’t travel to BRC due to lost jobs, closed borders, health issues etc. Now, after the Burning Man Project announcement about not building BRC 2020, this project is radically including all of us.\n\nOver the past few days, I have also learned about similar endeavours and stunning artwork being born. A great artist and amazing human being, Scotland Symons, has recreated a tiny version of the infamous Black Hole Bar on playa.\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nMy heart skipped a beat when I saw the pictures; the resemblance is uncanny. Scotland has started Tiny Burn — Build Your Own Tiny Camp Challenge, which is encouraging people to use what they have at home, build what they love, and fill the void of canceled events (no matter if it’s BRC, a Regional Event, a convention or a camping trip) with fun and creativity.\n\nAnd that is not all. Rumours about a mini Gigsville started to flood Facebook, and then I finally found the brilliant art work by Kasey Smith. Her models are part of a fledgling theme camp in Gigsville that she, Chris Estes and Diane Wellman have put together.\n\n“We’re all HO scale railroad modelers, so we’re building a HO-scale mashup of Burning Man and Santa’s Village called the Ho Ho Ho Dome,” said Kasey.\n\n“I’m starting my portion of the model with Gigsville, so we have a CarBQ, our bar, and some of our playa events like PlayaTrans and Jalapeno Fisting depicted, with a couple more signature Gigsville elements in the works. Eventually the model is going to live in a series of glass tables that will make up the bar for our hot chocolate bar.”\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nShe promised to eventually update their Instagram with the project. In the meantime, you can enjoy parts of mini Gigsville and the dust storm in Kasey’s photos above.\n\nNo matter what we call it and how we do it. Let’s create it, our HOME, now away from HOME, at our HOME and share it with each other. The possibilities are endless!\n\nScotland and I (and maybe someone else we don’t know about yet) will be collecting your creations and sharing them with the world. We have time. Let’s stay in touch.\n\nWe’ve been told many times that from nothing, we can create everything! Well, thanks Larry, we are going to do that now, once again.\n\nFor more information about the BRC Multiverse project, you can contact me here, join us on Facebook or stay tuned via the website.\n\nYou may be wondering how this relates to our plans for VBRC… we’re asking ourselves the same questions.
