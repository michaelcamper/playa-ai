I’m Jewish.” He then says to my face.\nAnd I paused before answering, the wind filling the space.\n\nThese words from his mouth, were just words he was taught.\nOld ideologies learned – that had come here, to this spot.\n\n“Santa doesn’t hate you. Santa wants to give you a gift!”\nPresented with a flourish – – “Fuck yer zip-tie.” He spits.\n\nDetermined to break through this veil of learned hate;\nThe night’s further adventures will just have to wait.\n\nReaching back into the bag, my hand finds the key;\nThe world disappears, now it’s just him and me.\n\nMy hand closes round Snoopy, a well traveled friend;\nWhen this kid sees what I have, his hate comes to an end.\n\n“I love Snoopy.” He says, with a young sheepish grin.\nNow I reach in the bag, finding that zip-tie again.\n\n“Santa wants you to have him, let’s put him here.”\nZip-ing Snoopy to his backpack, the message is clear.\n\n“See, his head swivels round, he’ll watch your back.\nOr keep an eye on you, from right here, on your pack.”\n\n“Thank you Santa.” He hugs me – his eyes filled with tears.\nI say “Good-bye” to Snoopy… (Hey, I’ve had ‘em for years!!)\n\nThen this kid turns to Santa beside me – now hugging him tight;\n“Thanks again Santa, I mean it.” “You guys have a great night!”\n\n“Merry Burn Night!” we both holler, as we watch him go.\n“How do you do that Santa?” “Hell, Santa, I don’t really know.”\n\nI never worry about the how – and this is all I know –\n“The gift is just a conduit, to a deeper, grateful flow…”\n\nby WendeWho!\n\noriginally posted on Piratess Philosophy",
