  "content": "Things are in full swing, and words are becoming kind of beside the point. The activities are taking off in a thousand different directions, with thousands of people at the helm.\n\nSo here are some random sentence fragments and ill-formed thoughts:\n\na) Weather completely gorgeous (moderately hot, with a chance of dust)\nb) Esplanade very big and surprisingly easy to get lost on at night. Weird but true.\n\nc) Where would we be without Moto (who can fix broke-ass art cars)? I’ll tell you exactly where we’d be; still trying to push the Trojan Sloth back home.\nd) Fire, fire everywhere.\ne) There is a drop-box for glow-sticks at around 5:30 and D. Use it.\nf) Pabst is the vitamin water of Black Rock City, and Jameson’s is the WD-40.\ng) Ice cream. Must. have. ice. cream.\nh) What the hell day is this?\ni) Reverend Billy is a good dancer.\n\nj) One of the most phenomenal photographers here is Dimitre, who had a reception last night at the Commissary. He’s so good he makes you want to put away your  camera  and weep quietly in the corner. Also? An amazingly good guy.\nk) Age is just a frame of mind; except when you feel it in your bones.\n\nAnd here are some pictures (the black and whites are by Dimitre, too). I hope they suffice for now.",
