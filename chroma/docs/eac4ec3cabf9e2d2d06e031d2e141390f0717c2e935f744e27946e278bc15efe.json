  "content": "In the last edition of The Burner’s Guide to Leaving No Trace, you and I got knee-deep into your camp trash can. That was fun, but we don’t need to keep wading around in it, do we? So this time, I’ll teach you how to take that trash and turn it into gold!\n\nDid you know that there is a Burning Man trash economy? Second only to the gift economy, the EXodus TRAsh and Recycling Network (EXTRA for short) is a bustling system of collection points for trash disposal, free recycling, and charitable donations, all of which directly benefit Burning Man and local communities in Nevada.\n\nHow does EXTRA work for you and your garbagio? Read on to find out.\n\nEXTRA: How Does It Work?\n\nIt’s pretty awesome, I must say. Communities and local businesses along all routes from Black Rock City have convenient drop-off centers that are open 24 hours in the days following Burning Man.  This year, September 1-5, you can dispose of:\n\nHuman and other hazardous waste is NOT accepted! Keep your ca-ca to yourself!\n\nEven though many of the drop-off points are stores, you won’t be expected to shop. Just pull in, sort, and deposit your clean(ish) materials, and go on your merry way.\n\nWhere Do I Go?\n\nIf you’re headed SOUTH, EAST, or WEST:\n\nTrash Pros\n1299 Washeim Street, State Route 447, Wadsworth, NV, 775-575-0707 (just north of Wadsworth) – map\n\nSave Mart Supermarkets\n•  525 Keystone Avenue, Reno, NV, 775-786-2150 – map\n•  9750 Pyramid Lake Highway, Sparks, NV, 775-425-2700 – map\n•  565 East Prater Way, Sparks, 775-359-9060 – map\n•  195 West Plumb Lane, Reno, NV, 775-786-0138 (back of store) – map\n\nWhole Foods Market\n6139 South Virginia Street, Reno, NV, 775-852-8023 – map\n\nIf you’re headed NORTH:\n\nThe Cedarville Collective (at Rabbit Traxx Store)\n580 Patterson Way, Cedarville, CA, 530-279-2022 – map\n\nProceeds beyond recovery of program expenses at all of these locations will be donated to help support new Black Rock Solar installations or other local community programs in the region. Non-perishable food and water will be donated to local food banks, and bicycles will be donated to local bike programs in support of kids in need. Your participation in the sixth year of this multi-community project is greatly appreciated!\n\nYou’ll also see some mom-and-pop collection spots along Highway 447 in Gerlach, at the Nixon Store, and at the I-80 Smoke Shop in Wadsworth. These aren’t part of the EXTRA program, and they only collect trash, but using their disposal services is another way to help out local economies.\n\nAll this information is in your survival guide, so bring it with you!  When you arrive in Black Rock City, you’ll also get an EXTRA flyer with the information and maps to drop-off points. Hang it on your mirror so it’ll be there when Burning Man is over.\n\nThis fantastic program is the result of hard work by several communities, businesses and individuals — including Nathan Aaron Heller, who co-founded and coordinates this project.  Thanks Nathan, and everyone who’s made EXTRA possible.\n\nAnd thank YOU for Leaving No Trace, on and off the playa!\n\nNext issue of The Burner’s Guide to Leaving No Trace: RECYCLE CAMP!",
