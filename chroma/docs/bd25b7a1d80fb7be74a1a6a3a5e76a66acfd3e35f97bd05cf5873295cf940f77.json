  "content": "I was driving in my neighborhood recently, when a particular billboard caught my eye. Two versions of SpiderMan from different multiverses are engaged in what appears to be a pretty intense conversation, while crouched atop some high perch overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge (as one does).\n\nThe original SpiderMan (Peter Parker) is telling his young prodigy/alternative-universe self (Miles Morales), “EVERYTHING YOU SAY AND DO CREATES AN IMPACT.”\n\nSeems obvious enough, really … but apparently not so obvious that it doesn’t bear repeating, passed down from one angsty self-absorbed vigilante to an up-and-coming neophyte.\n\nWhen we were digging through the BLM’s voluminous Draft Environmental Impact Statement recently, we were reminded — in exhaustive detail — of the impact we Burners have on the environment around us. Not just the physical world environment, mind you, but the cultures with whom we come in contact — the people who love us, the ones who can’t live without us, the ones who would rather we quietly go away, and even our fellow Burners.\n\nWe’ve talked for ages (literally nearly 30 years) about mitigating our impact on the environment, because we know full well the delicate balancing act that is our residency on the Black Rock Desert, and how easily it can be taken away from us with a few wrong moves.\n\nI mean hell, we seriously have a 99.98% Leave No Trace mandate from the BLM, or we don’t get our permit for the next year’s event. That’s not an exaggeration. We have to pick up EVERYTHING off the playa short of .02% of detritus, following a bacchanalian week’s worth of 80,000 people living a full-throated life in the desert, or we don’t get to do it again. The average size of that detritus (or MOOP, as we like to call it) is ¼”, and it’s spread across seven square miles under a layer of constantly shape-shifting playa dust. That’s utterly ridiculous. But the more ridiculous part is that we have successfully accomplished this seemingly-impossible feat for 3 decades … without fail.\n\nThis is 100% due to the diligence of each and every (well, just about) Burning Man participant to Leave No Trace so that Black Rock City’s Playa Restoration team has any chance in hell to finish the job, picking up the bits that are inevitably (and understandably) missed. Without everybody’s awareness and participation in this magnificent feat, Burning Man would have been dead and gone a long time ago.\n\nMany of us veterans take it for granted, and new folks need to be made aware of the fact that everything you say and do  — not just MOOPing your camp or not properly tying down the load atop your playafied Chitty Chitty Bang Bang of a vehicle — creates an impact, for better or worse.\n\nSo we thought this might be a good opportunity to take a philosophical tour of what it means to be a Burner, and the myriad ways we impact the world around us while we’re doing what we do. This goes well beyond picking up after yourself. It’s an opportunity to be alerted to the stuff we’re likely not even aware of, and to be reminded of the ripple effects we generate, so we can consider our impact and step up our game.\n\nWe’ll explore the very real impacts (good and bad) we have on the small towns we pass through en route to and from the playa. We’ll look at the impact our seemingly innocuous actions have, and how simple they are to fix. We’ll even talk about the power of positive interactions and how they can change perceptions and develop relationships. Really this is going to be an entertaining spelunk into the deeper reaches of the 10 Principles which, it’s worth remembering, don’t begin and end at the playa’s edge. You’re likely to glean ideas that apply as much in your day-to-day life as they do when encircled (well, en-pentagoned, more accurately) by an orange trash fence.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this series and the stories. We hope you get at least a little inspired, and learn something along the way, even if your mentors are wearing pink tutus and unicorn horns rather than a Spandex bodysuit.\n\n[This post is part of our ‘Consider Your Impact’ series, where we’re telling stories that explore our community’s known and lesser-known effects on not just the Black Rock Desert itself, but the world around us as well. We hope it will raise awareness and inspire you to, well, consider your impact. Hence the name.]\n\nTop photo by Will Roger Peterson",
