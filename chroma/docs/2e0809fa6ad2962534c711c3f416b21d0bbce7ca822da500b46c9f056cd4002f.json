  "content": "Burning Man Arts is thrilled to announce we are creating a new grant program for the Temple, which will start in 2018.\n\nThe Temple is typically the largest participant-created art installation on playa. It’s an incredibly complex undertaking, with a crew in the hundreds, fundraising goals of over $100K, and a real labor of love.\n\nBurning Man Project supports the Temple each year with up to $100k in funding and resources such as decomposed granite, water, fuel and some equipment. But we care deeply about assisting these amazing artists, so we’re always looking for ways to support them better.\n\nAnd the number one piece of feedback that we receive from artists? “We need more time!”\n\nSo that is exactly what we are giving you: more time. We will now start the Temple grant cycle in September 2017 and notify applicants in December.\n\nHow BRC Temple Grants Worked in the Past\n\nSince 2002, proposals to build the Temple in Black Rock City (BRC) have been submitted as part of the BRC Honoraria grant process and grouped together with all the other artists who want funding to build art on playa.\n\nThis means Temple artists have also waited until March to be notified about the success of their proposal, leaving only five months to secure a work space, recruit their crew, and develop and implement a fundraising plan — let alone the actual fun part of building the piece.\n\nMaking the Change\n\nThe Temple isn’t dependent on the annual theme, so we were able to adjust the timeline and start the submission process earlier in the year. This will not only give the Temple artists more time to build and fundraise, but it will also allow Burning Man Arts to more clearly define what resources we can provide to the Temple artists.\n\nHow to Apply for the 2018 BRC Temple Grant\n\nBuilding the Black Rock City Temple is a significant undertaking. It’s also a chance to realize a dream and create a space for thousands of participants to have meaningful experiences.\n\nIf this sounds like you, the first step is reading this essay by John “Moze” Mosbaugh about the history and significance of the BRC Temple. Then, head on over to our brand new BRC Temple Grant Page for the juicy details on available resources, what we are looking for in a successful proposal, and how to apply.\n\nTop photo: The Temple Project by David Best and The Temple Crew, 2016 (Photo by Jamen Percy)",
