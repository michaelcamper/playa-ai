  "content": "They hail from cities and traditions that span the globe — from Black Rock City to Hyderabad, New Orleans to Barcelona. Each of the artists who generously contributed their work to Boundless Space has a remarkable journey to share, one that ultimately intersects with Burning Man, and now with you.\n\nIt has been, and continues to be a challenging time for artists, and for the nonprofit organizations that support them. Our collaboration with Sotheby’s succeeded at establishing new connections and generating funds for the participating artists and Burning Man Project.\n\nRead on to meet the 19 artists whose work is available for purchase through Boundless Space… The Possibilities of Burning Man until January 6, 2022.\n\n•           •           •\n\nJoe Sale\n\n“There I was at Burning Man, the epicenter of art, culture and personal expression and I couldn’t even muster the courage or ability to take a picture. I was in complete awe. For the first time in my life, I was experiencing culture shock, lost in my mind, in an unfamiliar world and then it happened…I saw the magic and I captured it.”\n\nHuman Transformations – Burning Man 2019 was shot on a 40-year-old Hasselblad 500c. “The medium format Hasselblad produces a square negative, hence the 40×40 shape. This piece took more than 70 hours to compose and was printed and finished in Dusseldorf, Germany. This one-of-a-kind piece will never be reproduced.“\n\nErin Douglas\n\n“My entry into Burning Man was not planned. It was by way of a gifted ticket and completely trusting the friends who felt I should be there. I wouldn’t call my first experience a blast. It was difficult, challenging, scary, and overwhelming. It was also magical, unexplainable, and unique.”\n\nErin Douglas is a travel and lifestyle documentary photographer and founder of Black Burner Project. Her mission: “create a space where Burners of color can be seen as part of the community, create awareness and drive diversity.”\n\nJennybird Alcantara\n\n“The basis of what I’m expressing in my work is the complexity, the beauty and the tragedy of life itself. I feel like I am exploring and illustrating the cycle of life but from the soul’s vantage point. My way of speaking with the world is through images and my paintings are the visual language that people who follow, enjoy or collect my work understand.”\n\nThe Seduction was a part of the series a solo show in 2018 “Reveries of the Untamed Darlings”. Alcantara says, “To me it’s a play that is taking place for the birds below, and the tension of the piece is deciding if this scene is going to be a rapturous or a savage one.”\n\nNilofer Suleman\n\nNilofer Suleman approaches her paintings in the spirit of a storyteller who enjoys nesting one episode inside another, arranging them within framed narratives and larger, circulating cycles of tales.\n\nMapmakers Tours and Travels is a step into a cartographical otherworld. Painted in miniature style brushstrokes, it blurs the lines between reality and magic-realism, much like the streets of India and the fantastical landscape of the playa. This piece has been hand painted meticulously in the miniature styles of India, with a single hair brush over three months of devotion.\n\nAlinka Echeverria\n\nAlinka Echeverría is a Mexican-British artist and visual anthropologist working in multiple media. She holds a Masters degree in Social Anthropology and Development from the University of Edinburgh. After working on HIV prevention projects in East Africa, she pursued a post graduate degree in Photography from the International Center for Photography in New York. Her research based work brings a contemporary and critical approach to questions of visual representation.\n\nDawn DeDeaux\n\nDeDeaux’s work is widely exhibited, with recent exhibitions at MassMoCA and Arthur Roger Gallery. A 50-year career retrospective opened at the New Orleans Museum of Art on October 21, 2021. Titled Dawn Dedeaux: The Space Between Worlds, the exhibition runs through January 23, 2022. Acid Frog Playin’ Like Puff Daddy focuses on the extinction of animals, and soon, perhaps, humankind.\n\nJOJO ABOT\n\n“As an interdisciplinary artist of African heritage employing a philosophy of Message Over Medium, I remain spirit led in channeling living technologies that bring us to a state of presence, connectedness and healing. My offerings in music, film, photography, fine art, fashion and more serve as portals to the divine while invoking deep remembrance of ancestral spirit. Ta Kpe Kpe is a manifestation of a meeting of Gods — Mawu, Sogbo, Lisa as per Ewe mythology. The creator, the created, the creation, all at once and all together in constant sacred alchemy.”\n\nRyan McNamara\n\nBrooklyn-based artist Ryan McNamara works in a multitude of media and methods including performance, installation, photography, and sculpture. Born and raised in Arizona, many of his works have a collaborative or participatory quality, incorporating elements of theater and dance into site- or situation-specific installations and events.\n\nMario Moore\n\nMario Moore employs the Black body in paintings to show power and resilience through the denial of the colonial gaze. He redefines the gaze for the subjects he paints, allowing them to look directly out in an unflinching stare. The historical references within the work draw parallels to the social, economic and racial occurrences of today.\n\n“Siriusly is about the Sirius star within Canis Major and the knowledge that was bestowed to man as referenced by the Dogon Tribe. It is at once about human knowledge and also those things that we don’t know.”\n\nLena Viddo\n\n“My paintings blend classical themes, pop culture and the natural world into allegorical commentaries in which I explore the ambivalence and discomfort I feel in relation to popular culture and the status quo. My list of concerns is long and I focus on narcissism, self interest, hypocrisy, the tyranny of beauty, the idolatry of money and materialism.“\n\nMoon Age Daydream was created for an exhibition held in the former residence of the late rock star artist, David Bowie in 2019. Viddo was inspired by the poetry and lyrics of Bowie’s song Moon Age Daydream which opens with “I’m an Alligator…”\n\nTM Davy\n\n“Art works for me as a meditation on being in relationship with life. Light and love become each other when form is also a feeling … The painting in this auction is of a horse eating grass. Horses have long played inside my practice, but this body of work began after a strange synchronicity. I discovered that my gallery at 195 Chrystie Street was located exactly where my ancestors had once run a livery horse stable after coming to NY in the late 1800s. I followed this fact toward making and meaning, devoting the next few years to the horse as a natural and mythic mirror of our coevolution.”\n\nCisco Jimenez\n\nCisco Jiménez was born in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. He is a contemporary artist whose work includes drawing, painting, sculpture and installation that focuses on Mexico’s social and political environment. Jiménez was a recipient of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte (SNCA) art grant from 2014-2016, which is one of Mexico’s most significant grant programs created by the Mexican Ministry of Culture.\n\nDavid Yarrow\n\nDavid Yarrow is now recognised as the world’s best-selling fine art photographer of his genre. In recent years, he has found his true comfort zone in capturing the animal and human world in a fresh and creative way, with philanthropy and conservation central to his passion to document.\n\n“This image is deliberately reductive and there is no lofty ambition. But therein lies its strength. It is a paradox that white is such a strong colour, and it is probably at its best in abstract imagery with no depth of focus.”\n\nBetsabee Romero\n\n“Rufina Ruiz, ‘ceramist master’ opened her workshop and home with her honest and bright smile, and immediately I wanted to work with her … I showed my work on cars and tires and she showed me her beloved oven and team. I proposed to her to create some special hubcaps in glazed ceramic, produced and finished on a tire with some leaves and flowers from her garden and surroundings.”\n\n“By Introducing this new type of manual, personal, slow and laborious process on this industrial vehicle, we were … breaking boundaries between handcrafts and industrial things crossing through this solid, industrial and speed process of the modern world that has crashed nature and culture on its path.”\n\nMichelle Stuart\n\nStuart uses the vast archive of analog and digital photographs that she has taken and collected for almost half a century, activating their aesthetic potential by re-contextualizing them in groups, and often altering them to weave personal stories. These dreamlike recollections of her past not only continue her lifelong artistic engagement with specific locations but affirm the significance of place as a unique source of memory.\n\nSlim Safont\n\nBarcelona Muralist and painter Nil (Slim) Safont is mainly interested in urban art and interventions in public space. His works are large-format paintings that use the walls of the streets as canvases.\n\n“This painting is born from a photograph taken in the streets of the city of Barcelona,” explains Safont. “The image tries to suggest a reflection on the differences and inequalities between social classes, highlighted visually in an image in which the idea of ‘property’ is represented in two very unequal ways in the same scene.”\n\nScott Benzel\n\n“Benzel combines remnants and ephemera to illustrate how often our most meaningful relationships form through a triangulation of contingency, timing and pure luck. Each work embeds an element of risk, sometimes via a performative creative process, or by framing chance encounters in the context of an exhibition.” —Lee Foley\n\nOne of a series of addenda to Benzel’s 2020 exhibition Mindless Pleasures, the work LSD Cologne combines ready-made elements to continue the artist’s investigation into the ways in which consumer objects, principles of composition and display apparatus act upon the human consciousness.\n\nMarc Breslin\n\nMarc Breslin works primarily as a painter. Themes of location and time, their loss and rejuvenation, persist in his work, yielding a variety of subjects that conflate the personal and the public. A vast majority of his paintings highlight the use of positive and negative space. He views his practice as an opportunity to create “shared encounters both art historically and personally.”\n\nJose Alvarez\n\n“The sources of my inspiration come from a wide range of scientific, cosmological and mathematical theories, including my keen interest in anthropological research and visionary ritual practice … Using diverse media, the concept of inner and outer exploration is key in the development of the different aspects of the work. I’d like the viewer to get lost in each piece, to elevate them through the use of different techniques and materials.”",
