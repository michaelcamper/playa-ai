  "content": "Have you heard of “The Harrisons”? Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison are leading pioneers of the eco-art movement. Most often you will see them referred to as “the Harrisons”. They have been working artists for almost forty years, collaborating and crossing disciplinary lines. Much like many other cultural innovators they pay no attention to lines; to them everything is fair game for appropriation in their artwork – biology, history, ecology, architecture, public utilities, urban planning, etc. By repurposing these disciplines they have been able to create a “dialogue to uncover ideas and solutions which support biodiversity and community development.” Their dialogue has often extended outside the context of art leading to changes in environmental policies.\n\nBut why are they important? Art and culture at Burning Man have not been created in a vacuum; we have ancestry and the Harrisons I include in that lineage.\n\nThey will be lecturing tomorrow at the recently opened David Brower Center in Berkeley.\n\nHelen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison\nPresented with the Long Now Foundation\nWednesday June 10, 02009\n7:00pm – 9:00pm\n2150 Allston Way,\nBerkeley, CA 94704",
