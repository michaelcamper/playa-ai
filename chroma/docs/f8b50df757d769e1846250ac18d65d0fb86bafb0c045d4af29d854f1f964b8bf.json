  "content": "The other week a high ranking member of BMIR’s staff got very drunk at my place.\n\n“Caveat!” he said, “You know what you should do?  You should write some Public Service Announcements for BMIR!”\n\nHe tried to take it back the next day, but it was too late.  I work fast.\n\nSince then I’ve heard that my PSAs will have to be screened for things like “Accuracy” and “Relevance” – so you might not hear them on the playa.  So I thought I’d preview them here.  You know – to be helpful.  You can’t keep a public service down.\n\nToday’s lesson:  Leave No Trace!\n\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\nOr Click Here\n\nEnjoy!  Learn more about leaving no trace here, and if there’s a topic you’d like me to produce a PSA for, drop me a line.\n\nCaveat is the Volunteer Coordinator for Media Mecca at Burning Man.  His opinions are in no way statements of the Burning Man organization.  Contact him at Caveat (at) Burningman.com",
