Is it true? If so, where can we get more information?\n\nThanks much,\nTrevor\n\nHey Trevor-\n\nThe answer is no. And yes. Isn’t the playa great?\n\nThe Burning Man Project ( or ORG ) isn’t providing solar power. That said, I do know of at least two places on the playa where there will be some kind or another of solar charging stations. One will be at the Green Man Pavilion ( quite small, think iPods and camera batteries ) and the other somewhere on the open playa. No more details at this time ( if you know more, let me know ) but as always: radical self reliance. Would be a shame to see people lining up to recharge because they hadn’t planned ahead. Thanks for writing, hope that helps!\n\n-Tom Price\n\nEnvironmental Manager\n\nBurning Man 2007",
