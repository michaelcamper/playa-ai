It’s gonna be a good day.\n\nThe autumn days here in the Black Rock have been sunny and calm, a bit on the warm side maybe. The pre-season bugs have not returned, the dust storms haven’t been battering our skin, eyes and lungs … heck, it isn’t even too cold in the mornings.\n\nWith calm and clear conditions, the Playa Restoration line sweepers are making good progress. On Day 2, they marched through 54 city blocks, along the back ‘burbs of Black Rock City. What they found was a mixed bag, if we’re being honest here. Again, the vast majority of the territory was impressively vacant of moop. However, a couple of spots got a little out of control. Want to see? Of course you do!\n\nWe sure love all that green, folks. Thank you to everyone who really tried to Leave No Trace this year. And for those who really tried, but wound up in (or near) a yellow or red zone: you know what, it was a dusty year. When it’s mega dusty, the moop can be pretty hard to find. So we get it. There’s always room to improve, and there’s no such thing as perfection – right? Right.\n\nAnd Now: Major Buzzkill\n\nThis year, I want to introduce you to a few of the many fascinating, beautiful people of the DPW. And to kick it off, here’s one of my personal favorite humans: Major Buzzkill. I asked him to share some of his thoughts on Burning Man, DPW, and life, and here’s what he had to say.\n\nBuzzkill joined the Black Rock City Department of Public Works in 2002, and came back in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. Then he stopped, and went back to focusing on his career for six years. In 2015, he returned to the DPW with a new outlook.\n\nFamily is where you find it, and our family is lucky to have a Major Buzzkill in it. Love you buddy.\n\nThat’s all for today, folks. Call a friend this weekend and tell ’em you love ’em.\n\nThen come on back soon for more moop, more map, more people and more stories!\n\nFollow along with the Playa Restoration team:\n\nThe Hun is on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Flickr, and Summer Burkes is on Twitter too!",
