  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is back with a second season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS02 E13 – On Thursday, It’s Birthday Thursday\n\nA far-ranging conversation with our new friend and volunteer, Mother of Goats. (You’ll hear about her goat, Frank, in an episode next season.) The history of Camp Orphan Endorphin, created by and for strangers with no camp affiliation. A little about Hug Deli, and probably a little too much about Annie. (The musical. With Daddy Warbucks. ’cause Rex.) The importance of toilet paper. Don’t let just anybody play music at your camp. Also, church of the ceiling cat is an actual thing.\n\nS02 E14 – Hippies in Togas Smeared Across the Playa\n\nSueno, architect of the the g-d Temple of Promise, tells D-Day and Rex all about designing, building, and burning giant art at Burning Man. How the Trojan Horse LITERALLY put the cart before the horse. A great idea for a Theme Camp, what sketch-up is good for, and the Alien Siege Machine nearly kills its creators. We think you’ll probably experience more bugs at Regionals, even if there is a river. The overwhelming lightness of being Argentinian. Plus, you should read your ticket, because nothing is up to code in Black Rock City. Also, have you heard about Kickstarter? Apparently it’s a thing for funding, which is what we need, pleasies and thanks you! You can find out more about the incredible swag and gifts that can be yours right here.\n\nAccuracy Third needs your help! If you like what we’re doing, please subscribe to our podcast and rate us in iTunes, the Google Play store, or Stitcher.
