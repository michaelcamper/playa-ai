He says he is making the world’s largest clock.\n\n“Black Rock City is a clock, God damn-it ― biggest in the world,” says Tony Coyote, Black Rock City’s Superintendent.\n\nIts hands stretch over a mile and are made of people walking circles in the desert, pointing lasers at each other to measure the distances between the hours and etching the face of the clock upon the desert floor. This is the process of surveying Black Rock City, and it’s completed by the Survey Crew who over the course of a week will measure every point of consequence from Lustrate Street to the Temple and beyond.\n\nThere is no other city like Black Rock City. A city that rises from and returns to dust, that redraws its annular alphabetical streets every year. Emerging from the single point of The Golden Spike at the center of the Man Base and drawing a line to the Temple which is traced to an arc, a circle, a series of concentric circles, and evolving into a hustling bustling metropolis of 70K complete with federal compound, airport, fire department, emergency medical services and midnight poutine.\n\nTerry “Retro” Schoop redraws the city plan, then Survey Crew manifests the design etching the city into the dust in the Radical Ritual of the seeding ceremony. The lay lines for the city are drawn and the working class town of DPW descends to build the infrastructure soon attracting artists to this small town before the tent-opolis of Black Rock City emerges.\n\nThe Survey Crew is a small encampment with a City plan. Their humble camp takes shelter in and measures the city from the Octagon.\n\n￼\n\n\n\n\n\nThough many cities are similar, no two cities are identical. There is a city unlike any other city, it can be found in the dry arid endorheic Pleistocene lake bed of ancient Lake Lahontan.\n\nBurning Man begins with a single point, The Golden Spike at the center of The Man’s Base. A point becomes a line to Temple, then an arc, a circle, 14 rows of concentric streets and the radical ritual of the seeding ceremony is complete.\n\n￼\n\n“We start with South. That’s how the whole cities oriented. South is 4:30. So if I go to 0, that’s the Temple. I’m thinking I can get a team of three and a Kushman to get the four cardinal points which will set your promenades,” Coyote says with the vigor of a man with the conviction of experience.\n\nhttps://shalaco.smugmug.com/Burning-Man/2017-Survey-1/i-QcLptHk\n\nSurvey Crew members describe the process of laying out Black Rock City in their own words.\n\n￼\n\nTrailer Park Romeo\n\n￼\n\n\nBooyah\n\nSquirrelly\n\nBlackthorn\n\n￼\n\nProfessor Plague\n\nD.A.\n\nFondue\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BXb09KbFFYa/?taken-by=shalaco",
