A quick spin through the internet will tell you that it takes approximately 21-30 days to create a new habit. Even if you procrastinate for a few days (oh, you), there’s still time to get in the groove of some useful habits before the gates of Black Rock City (metaphorically…no actual gates, but lots of Gate) swing open to embrace your soon-to-be-dusty butt.\n\nFor what things should I be developing a pattern of behavior, you might inquire? I’m glad you asked.\n\nRide Your Bike\nThat aforementioned butt will thank you. Begin by riding down to your locally-owned bike shop and getting your trusty steed a tuneup. Make sure you have an extra tube for on playa, while you’re at it. Then, go ride your bike, a little bit every day! Roll down a street you’ve never explored, run some errands, obtain a baguette and pedal home with it sticking out of your bike basket. If you don’t get used to riding your bike now, your first few biking days on playa will be sore ones. There should be certain cuss words reserved specifically for the feeling of mounting your bike first thing in the morning after riding a lot the day before, if you’re unused to being in the saddle. I bet there’s a German word for it.\n\nDrink Water\nIf you’ve not developed the custom of sipping at water all the livelong day, it’s easy to forget once you’re surrounded by the constant overstimulation of Burning Man. Plus, the first few days of increased water intake, your body tends to want to urinate frequently. Better to get this adjustment period out of the way now, rather than on the long drive down Highway 447 or sitting in line at the Gate. Proper prior planning prevents prolific peeing, my grandmother used to say. Just as important is keeping your electrolytes in balance, and you can’t do that by drinking plain water. Add in some electrolyte powder to your water once or twice a day, or indulge in a can of coconut water. Protip: Coconut water with no added sugar can be found at Asian grocery stores for much cheaper than the designer brands at fancy natural-foods shops.\n\nTalk to Strangers\nBurning Man is the friendliest place on earth. It’s sometimes difficult, however, to go from zero to talking-to-everybody, particularly if you tend towards being shy. (Hey friend, if you’re shy, here’s some Tips for Shy People at Burning Man that might help). Getting into the groove of positive interactions with strangers, even just inconsequential exchanges in line at the grocery store or at the laundromat, will make sure you roll into Black Rock City ready to participate. Not to mention that once you’re putting out happy, interactive energy, you might just find that the world is smiling along with you.\n\nSee you in the dust!\n\n——–\n\nBrody works in the Art Department.
