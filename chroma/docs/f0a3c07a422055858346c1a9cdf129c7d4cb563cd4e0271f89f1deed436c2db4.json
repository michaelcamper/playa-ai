  "content": "Perhaps you recall an entry made last July that paid a visit to Assateague Island, the birthplace of Playa del Fuego. Welcome back dear readers to a visit to the actual PDF event.\n\nPDF occurs twice a year, once in the spring and again in October. It’s held outside of Odessa, DE on land owned and operated by the DE chapter of the Vietnam Vets Motorcycle Club. It’s a special treat to be granted the use of their space on Memorial Day Weekend.\n\nThe spring 2008 PDF was the biggest PDF to date with close to 1000 participants hailing from all over the North East US. As luck would have it, we were graced with the nicest weather ever and virtually zero insect friends feasting upon participants. Talk to any seasoned PDF participant and you’ll quickly learn that galoshes and bug spray are the two top items to pack.\n\nThe PDF participants brought their best to the table this spring. Camp Sexy served up coffee in the morning, Craigslist camp helped you do real time anything you can do on craigslist, Slumber Camp hooked you up with PJs and shade so you could catch some Zzzz’s, Bubbles and Bocce (With a Side of Bacon!) celebrated alliteration and the joys of their namesakes. Every which way you turned another camp was hosting an event or enticing you to stop by and say hello.\n\nOne of the biggest events was the Naked Slip and Slide contest. Judged by the Vets, this was a no camera event of epic proportions. Participants have perfected technique, style, and presentation in their slip and sliding revelry. With 800 Sq feet of slip and slide available, you can imagine just how creative it could get.\n\nNow let’s not forget the Pony! It wouldn’t be PDF without the Pony effigy. The pony serves as an homage to their roots at Assateague Island, where the event was first held.\n\nMultiple burns, sunshine, slip n slides, bacon… Playa del Fuego should definitely be on your radar for a Regional Burn experience.",
