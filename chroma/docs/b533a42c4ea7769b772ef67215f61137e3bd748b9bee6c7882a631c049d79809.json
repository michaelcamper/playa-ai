  "content": "TL;DR:\n\nBlack Rock City is built and inhabited by 80,000 creative and caring participants. As the nonprofit that supports this vibrant community, Burning Man Project aspires to nurture a culture of mutual respect and Civic Responsibility. In 2023, we experienced the worst accidents involving e-bikes to date. One injured participant required more than 20 stitches to their face, another was evacuated to Reno when their bladder was impaled, and multiple Burners were struck and left unconscious. In some cases, the e-bike operator just drove off.\n\nThis is entirely unacceptable.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2023 event, Burning Man Project discussed a range of ideas on how to end the speeding issue, including the possibility of banning e-bikes altogether. In the end, however, we didn’t want to make new rules, and we sincerely hoped a well-informed community would modify its behavior, as we believe that is always the best way forward. While some community members responded by being more responsible at the event, unfortunately, many did not.\n\nSo, in Black Rock City 2024, we are ramping up the efforts to curb reckless biking behaviors.\n\nClass 3 bikes are no longer permitted in Black Rock City, period. If you are found speeding or riding an e-bike unsafely, depending on the severity of the incident or behavior, the consequences may include removal of your e-bike and/or you from BRC.\n\nIf you bring an e-bike to Black Rock City, you agree to operate under these parameters:\n\nBlack Rock citizens and Burners everywhere excel at caring for each other, whether in the rain, dust storms or under any circumstance. Let’s continue to be the best for each other by traveling safely in our beloved city and behaving in ways that do not endanger fellow participants.\n\nAnd once more, for the folks in the back…\n\nFinally, remember that it’s all about the journey and not just the destination. Dismount, explore, and enjoy the wonders of Black Rock City!\n\nLet’s see how 2024 goes. If we are all part of the solution, there will be no need for more drastic action in the future.\n\nYour friendly neighborhood Event Director,\n– Louder, Charlie!\n\n(Cover photo by Kate Beale)",
