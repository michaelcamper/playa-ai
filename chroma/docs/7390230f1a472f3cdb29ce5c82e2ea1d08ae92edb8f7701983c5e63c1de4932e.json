  "content": "These last eight months have left me feeling angry, frustrated and confused. The murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor (to name just two) at the hands of police are piercing reminders of the systemic racism and police brutality embedded in our society.\n\nWith the cancellation of Black Rock City, my friends and campmates had a lot of pent up energy to create something. So we got together to do what we do best: make big art and share it with our community!\n\nCreating Big Art for Social Change\n\nNeon Voices is an animated, billboard-sized combination of letters and graphics covered in LEDs that can be easily deployed and configured.\n\nIt’s message: Black Lives Matter. Sitting atop the words is a gorgeous animated design of interlocking hands, designed by artist Abi Mustapha.\n\nThe idea came from the storefronts in Oakland, which have been boarded up during the pandemic. Even as it has been eerie, we have watched with joy as artists turned the plywood into canvases to express beautiful messages of peace and love, urging us all to recognize what’s happening around us.\n\nBringing Black Rock City Skills into the World\n\nI’m usually among the people who offer support from the sidelines. But one of the things I do know how to do, thanks to Burning Man, is to make cool shit with my friends! I feel incredibly fortunate to have a year-round community of Burner friends and family and volunteers who work together as The Crisis Labs Art Collective in an industrial shop in Emeryville California, right next to Oakland.\n\nUsing my training as an engineer I’ve built a variety of wearable tech projects and placed installations. And over the last decade our crew has created several projects on playa. Going bigger and bigger each year, in 2014 we ramped up to deploy my largest project to date — lumenEssence, a field of thirty three 30’ tall flexible towers that displayed coordinated LED designs and reacted to the environment (wind, sound and time). In my most recent Black Rock City adventure I contributed to the Red Hot Beverly art car, a giant fire-and-music-spewing fire extinguisher captained by my dear friend Marvin Lew. We like to say: “We Put Out Fire!”\n\nAn Open-Source LED Project You Can Build Too\n\nWhen the Neon Voices idea emerged, the crew at Crisis Labs came together to figure out how to use our skills, energy, and creativity to make an impact on the world around us.\n\nWhat emerged were 16 30-inch letters, CNC cut, treated to withstand the elements, and outlined with hundreds of LEDs which simulate neon lights.\n\nThe LEDs are controlled wirelessly through a Raspberry Pi computer, which can be programmed to produce patterns using the letters and graphics. I wanted to stick to the idea of making the letters look like old school neon with chunky animation to get just the right effect.\n\nThe Neon Voices project is open source. My hope is that other artists will use the technology to create their own large scale anti-racist LED-neon messages to light up other buildings and hilltops across the country.\n\nHere is the link for the open source library, which includes the building plans, bill of materials, programs, and instructions for building the art.\n\nA Random Encounter Leads to the Perfect Location\n\nWe started working on the piece before we had an idea of where it was going to be installed. We assumed that finding a location was going to be the easiest part of the project, but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. We had more than a few rejections from local building owners who said they didn’t want to get involved.\n\nOne night during a full system test outside of our shop in Emeryville, a city council member saw our work. After learning that we were having trouble finding a suitable location, he offered to tweet about our situation. It worked!\n\nThrough this tweet, we were connected to Rising Sun, a local organization that empowers individuals to achieve environmental and economic sustainability. Our project felt like a perfect fit for the organization’s mission. After connecting and coordinating, we were up and running within a few weeks.\n\nHow Can You Support Your Local Community?\n\nOur crew is used to working hard all spring and summer to bring new art, new ideas, and new projects to life for Black Rock City. For all of us Burners there was an additional sense of disorientation and loss this year to add to all the uncertainty and trauma that is happening in the world.\n\nI am so very grateful to have learned some powerful lessons from my time on the playa to help me through this.\n\nThe art of Neon Voices emerged from the stormy weather of the last months. Just like in the desert, it brought our crew together, gave us a common purpose, and pushed us to new levels of creativity and ingenuity.\n\nAs I write this, it’s 324 days until the Man burns. Let me be clear: I love Black Rock City. It is the place where I learned that I was an artist, and where I met so many of the people who bring me life, love, and joy. And, while there is so much to do to prepare to build Black Rock City again, there is also much more we can do to support and nurture our communities right where we live.\n\nWatch a video playlist of the finished Neon Voices installation, gloriously illuminated and animated.\n\nIf you’re interested in taking on a project like this please check out the open source link and feel free to reach out. I’d love to talk with you!\n\nCover: Neon Voices, 2020 by Abi Mustapha and The Crisis Labs Art Collective (Photo by Truman O’Brien)",
