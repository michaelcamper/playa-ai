And then we’ve wondered if it isn’t even more powerful: what if everybody at Black Rock City is really five degrees of separation from everyone else? Or four?\n\nThree?\n\nIt seems possible, but we could never prove it, right?\n\nWRONG! A team of researchers based out of MIT’s Media Lab has an experiment they’re going to conduct at Burning Man this year. Like all great Burning Man experiments, it will also lead to an art project: the first ever “Black Rock Atlas” – a map of the social patterns and networks that exist on the playa.\n\nThe Black Rock Atlas Team is going to send technological “vessels” through the gift economy of Burning Man, tracking how far they go and how many steps it takes them to get there. They need committed volunteers to ensure that the vessels reach their ultimate destination.\n\nThat’s where you come in. Do you like science? Or maps? Wanna help them map our in-person social networks?\n\nIf you are curious, inspired, or just generally interested in helping out, please fill out the THIS FORM (with the code MLP) and members of the Black Rock Atlas Team will reach out shortly to you shortly.\n\nYou will be supporting one of the most exciting scientific research efforts on the playa this year!\n\nFor more information, visit Black Rock Atlas’ website.",
