  "content": "It’s that time of year again… a small group of Burning Man staff is preparing to head to Austin next week for the annual SXSW extravaganza. Long before SXSW became the massive cultural phenomenon it is today, Burning Man staffers began going down to Austin to participate – to learn, to inform, to engage, to inspire and to be inspired.\n\nOver the years, we’ve facilitated and participated in a number of panels and workshops on topics ranging from managing intellectual property, participatory cities, and storytelling, to human resources, organizational culture, and play (yes, after thirty years in the desert, we think we’ve learned a thing or two about the importance of having fun!).\n\n2017 is no different. We’re facilitating a panel discussion and coordinating a couple of meetups. If you’re going to SXSW or you live in Austin, we would love to see you there!\n\nAnd there’s art! This year, SXSW launched a program to showcase innovative art by selecting installations from established and emerging artists to transform spaces into temporary immersive environments. The Advisory Board for the SXSW Art Program includes our very own Director of Art & Civic Engagement, Kim Cook. For more about the art, check out this corner of the internet.\n\nKim will also host a panel called with representatives from ArtPrize, Moment Factory, and the City of Vancouver. The panel, titled Exploring Impacts of Creative Urban Interventions, will explore the intersection of art and urbanism, including how creativity is transforming cities.\n\nWe’ve also coordinated a couple Burner meet-ups, one for anyone’s who’s interested on March 12 at local favorite (and Burner-owned!) Justine’s Brasserie, and another for SXSW badge-holders on March 14. Details below! If you’ll be in Austin next week, we look forward to connecting with you.\n\nPanel: Exploring Impacts of Creative Urban Interventions\n\nSat, Mar 11, 3:30-4:30pm\n\nJW Marriott, Salon H\n\nBadge Holder Meetup: SXSW Burning Man Meetup\n\nTues, Mar 14, 11am-12pm\n\nJW Marriott, Room 211-212\n\n(SXSW badge required)\n\nCommunity Meetup (No badge required!)\n\nPlease join folks from Burning Man HQ for an informal Austin meetup for Burners and anyone curious about Burning Man — come say hi, have drinks, eat snacks, and shoot the breeze. We’ll be in the backyard of Justine’s, just far enough away from the SX madness. We’d love to see you!\n\nSunday, March 12, 6-8pm\n\nJustine’s Brasserie\n\n4710 E 5th St, Austin, TX 78702",
