While some of the members of these teams will return in the morning for Leave No Trace, their art has been featured as the centerpiece of a city-wide night of celebration.\n\nBelow are a set of the images from this night of conflagration and joy. We hope you enjoy them and remember that wherever your region is, it is a part of the Burning Man community.",
