  "content": "The fine volunteers at Playa Info take great care of all the found items, including cameras and memory cards from Burning Man and SF Decompression. A small sampling of images from each of these items from 2009 are posted at the link below, with accompanying lost item inventory numbers, as in “09-###-G”.\n\nPeruse the images. If not your personal images, maybe you’ll spot those belonging to a friend? The people who camped next door? Stranger things have happened.\n\nVisit this Flickr Set.\n\nTwenty-four web photo pages of dusty, smiling burners!\n\nIf you spot your images, email lostandfound (at) burningman (dot) com and include:\n\nHurry: we end preceding-year found item return efforts when regular tickets go on sale mid-January for the current year. Yes, that means we’re done with 2009 items on January 13th, 2010.\n\nHere’s to happy reunions [para_end]",
