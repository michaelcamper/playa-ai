And to get one, you’re going to need to visit the DMV – the Department of Mutant Vehicles.\n\nTell us your favorite story of a visit to the DMV in the real world– oh, that’s right, you don’t have one. It’s a miserable, soul-sucking experience.\n\nNot too long ago, it wasn’t much different on the playa. Fantastic and fantastical vehicles would be lined up along the Esplanade, their owners looking for someone who could PLEASE check them in and get them on their way. It was pretty haphazard and frustrating for all concerned.\n\n“Frankly, we sucked,” Sparky was saying as a line of cars began taking shape in the morning sun. But things have changed, and Sparky seemed justifiably proud of the way the department has turned around.\n\n“It took us two years, but we completely redid everything,” Sparky said. “All new software, and a really robust database.” That database makes lots of things possible, including quicker and easier registration, and access to the clientele.\n\nTashi Pomo does the cooking for the big Osiris sound camp, and she was having trouble getting clearance for food deliveries. “So I called the DMV and asked if I could do a last-minute registration,” she said. There was no way that could happen, BUT, what the DMV could do was get out word to all of their already registered vehicles to see if someone might be able to step up and help. And of course someone did.\n\n“They saved me,” Tashi said.\n\nThis morning volunteers were getting training before the day’s first appointments would begin. Around 25 volunteers were being shown the ropes, and they included some lessons in customer service, and how to negotiate the iPads that would handle all the data input.\n\n“Remember to have fun,” the shift lead said. “If you’re not having fun, let’s change that.”\n\nThe vehicles were lined up in twelve-foot-wide lanes. This would separate the vehicles that were compact enough to negotiate city streets from those that would be confined to the open playa. The mood was light, and everything seemed quite orderly and upbeat. Five minutes later the first big rolling funhouses were on their way out to roam around Black Rock City.\n\nTake that, Sacramento.",
