  "content": "Here are some quick stories from the week, in hopes of giving you a little sense of what’s been happening at Burning Man.\n\nWhen the event starts, it is impossible to keep up with. The Roshomon effect is especially strong, except we’re not touching various parts of an elephant, but a fire-breathing Tyranosaurus.\n\nThe day starts early and ends late, it is full of both giant spectacles and tender intimacy. All things great and small.\n\nSo from our narrow little perspective, a peephole view of the past few days.",
