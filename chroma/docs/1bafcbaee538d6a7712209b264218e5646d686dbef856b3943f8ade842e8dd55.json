  "content": "The first comment we heard on Sunday morning after Precompression was:\n\nThis year we did something a little different. This event was held at one of our community’s best-loved art making spaces, NIMBY, to support local arts and artists! It was a multi-environment, indoor-outdoor, grease-monkey-to-glam, big art, downhome throwdown of artistically epic proportions! Burning Man and Burners—from old school to new—congregated at NIMBY.\n\nThere were Mutant Vehicles and art being created for\n\nBurning Man 2014 like The Alien Siege Machine and The Kraken. There was live glassworking by NIMBY artists, Maria Del Camino, Opulent Temple, Sugar Cubes, Alex Nolan’s Throw Bot, Grahmahs House, and about a gazillion more Bay Area artist groups showcasing their work and joining forces in support of this memorable night. There were places to gather, various dance floors, multiple live performance stages, and a great diversity of attendees.\n\nIn addition to all of that art and music and community, there was even a place to have your face painted. Gotta love all of that.\n\nYou can see more of Michael Fox’s photos of Precompression HERE.\n\nAnd then this happened!\n\nphotos: Michael Fox\nVideo: Tex Allen",
