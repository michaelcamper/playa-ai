You can find all his posts by clicking here. Enjoy!]\n\nThe 2013 CORE installations burn tonight. In about four hours. Yikes. I made these panoramas of each of the four CORE groups this morning because I wouldn’t get another chance. Click the image below to check ’em out. For best results, follow the instructions on the next page.\n\nOn that note, I’m going to change into my burn clothes and double check my gear, because at the stroke of 9 o’oclock tonight, these installations are gonna burn, big-time.  Should have pics of that later tonight.\n\nStay in touch on flickr, facebook or 500px.",
