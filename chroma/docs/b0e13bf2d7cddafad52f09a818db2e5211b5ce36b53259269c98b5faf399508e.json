  "content": "So, yeah there was an election in the U.S. and there has been some tension in its wake.\n\nAnd while Burning Man is generally above the realm of base politics, it still plays a role in the greater default world.  Look at Burners without Borders and the recent mobilization of Burners going From Black Rock to Standing Rock\n\nOr check out Red Lightning’s inspiring plans-in-progress to bring Playa-inspired shelter and more to North Dakota.\n\nBWB Program Director, Christopher Breedlove, explained the high level of Burner activism, “While many people credit Burning Man with putting them in touch with their inner-artist, many also credit Black Rock City with putting them in touch with their inner-citizen.  On the streets of BRC any citizen is immediately empowered to get involved, look for solutions, and propose community action to fix perceived problems– these lessons flow out into everyday life.”\n\nAnd just like a stranger handing you a cold mojito as you stumble in from a dust storm, there are a number of Burners working to add loving refreshment to the parched political landscape.\n\nP.S. This is not a post about politics – so please don’t use these comments as a venue for your views. These “Do-ocracy”  efforts by fellow Burners simply inspired me (and my 10-year-old nephew). But if you’ve got a better idea, DO IT!  And if you’re already doing something, SHARE IT!",
