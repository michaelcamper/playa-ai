  "content": "Burning Man Project is preparing to establish a year-round presence in the heart of downtown Reno, Nevada. The 2,800-square foot office will be in the historic Post Office building at 50 South Virginia Street, overlooking City Plaza (currently home to two beloved Black Rock City art installations). Burning Man Project’s Reno office will open later this fall.\n\nWhile the main Burning Man Project office will continue to operate in San Francisco, this new space will enable us to better support our operations in Northern Nevada, including the production of the Black Rock City event each August and our year-round activities at the 3,800 acre Fly Ranch acquired by the organization in June of 2016. This office will also help support operations and communications between our current offices in San Francisco and Gerlach, NV.\n\nBurning Man’s relationship with Reno goes back nearly 30 years and we’re inspired by the ways Reno has embraced Burning Man art and culture. Among many projects and initiatives driven by or adjacent to the Burning Man community, maker spaces including the Generator and Artech facilitate art and community building year-round, the Playa Art Project becomes home to a new collection of Burning Man art each year, and dozens more Burning Man art sculptures have been placed in the Reno area.\n\nIn 2017, Washoe County was awarded a $75,000 National Endowment for the Arts grant and is partnering with Burning Man Project to build a 200-mile art trail from Reno to Gerlach. And this year, Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve invited Burning Man to participate in a national conference of her peers, and then brought Mayors from around the nation with her to Black Rock City.\n\nWe’re enthusiastic about this new year-round office and look forward to deepening our longstanding ties to the Biggest Little City.\n\nTop photo by Bill Kositzky",
