  "content": "Many Burning Mans ago Chicken John walked around the desert and pounded some free-standing water spigots into the ground.  They weren’t attached to anything, of course:  it’s a dry lake bed, and there aren’t utility pipes for miles.\n\nBut people still walked up to them, held their canteens underneath, and turned the spigot … expecting something to happen.  They stared at it for 10, 20 seconds, waiting, wondering “Why isn’t the water coming?” before it finally dawned on them:  “oh yeah, no water.  Anywhere.”  I’ve seen video.  It’s hilarious.\n\nBut – true fact – people need water to survive.  And there isn’t any at Burning Man … unless you bring it!\n\nBut people often wonder:  “how much water should I bring?”\n\nFortunately we have the answer right here in our latest Public Service Announcement from Caveat and BMIR!\n\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\nOr click here\n\nIf you need more information, here are some other recent PSA’s you might enjoy.\n\nLeave no Trace!\nHow do I find my friends?\nPrepare for the Weather!\nCope with Traffic!\nMeet the Theme Camps!\nWhere do I find the Internet?\n\nCaveat is the Volunteer Coordinator for Media Mecca at Burning Man is Burning Man’s leading interpreter of Sea Chanties.  His opinions are in no way statements of the Burning Man organization.
