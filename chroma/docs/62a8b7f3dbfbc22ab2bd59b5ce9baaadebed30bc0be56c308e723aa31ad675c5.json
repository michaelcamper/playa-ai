Sunday, June 21, 2009, 7PM-10PM, at the West Street Market! This is a great opportunity to connect with friends and the Burning Man community, listen to some great music, drink a beverage of your choice, and generally chill out from the Big Bounce and Dada Motel, all the while supporting Black Rock Solar and the Pershing County School District- on the longest day of the year.\n\nThis event will feature performances by Kate Cotter, Tyler Stafford, Leroy Virgil, and Controlled Burn; a raffle with many fabulous prizes including TWO BURNING MAN TICKETS, beer supplied by Great Basin Brewing, and food and refreshment from the fabulous vendors in the West Street Market.\n\nBlack Rock Solar is a non-profit 501(c)(3) in the business of gifting solar power to schools and non-profits to marginalized and rural communities. As you drive to the Black Rock Desert, you drive past something in excess of 100 kW of solar generation facility installed by Black Rock Solar. To date, we have installed in excess of 300kW of solar generation capacity in Northern Nevada, saving schools and non-profits well over one million dollars.\n\nThe Pershing County School District has been hit very hard by budget cuts. Of approximately 40 teachers, 6 have been laid off in the past year. Black Rock Solar has raised about 90% of the resources needed to build a 50kW solar array, which will save the PCSD approximately $11,000.00 per year (at today’s rates!), and all at no cost to them. But we’re still about $15,000 short of what we need to make this project happen!\n\nLet’s show our broader community in Northern Nevada that we know how to affect creative and positive change, and have a great time while doing it!\n\nHAVE A GREAT TIME DOING SOMETHING TO STOP GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE!\n\nWest Street Market is at 148 West, in Reno, NV.",
