  "content": "After not building our home in the desert for two years, Black Rock City does indeed feel like a distant dream… yet here we are, fast approaching Burning Man 2022; our theme, Waking Dreams, couldn’t feel more appropriate. We exist because people dared to dream, and they dreamed big! Over the years, many artists have explored dreaming in their playa installations, from big to small, and from obvious to subtle. And this year promises to bring a new crop of wild imaginings.\n\nDreamers Past\n\nPepe Ozan‘s “The Dreamer,” on playa in 2005, was a large realistic purple head that appeared to be emerging from the dust, much in the surrealist spirit of Magritte. One could enter the head, a chamber of ceremonies, to experience the world of the mind as Pepe imagined it, in community around a fire pit.\n\n“The Dreamer” went on to live in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park from May to November 2007, courtesy of the Black Rock Arts Foundation; one can imagine how much surprise and amusement this caused for passersby.\n\nIn 2016, Michael Gard brought us “Dreams Of Flight,” two LED figures that appeared to be floating in the night sky. They were suspended from large helium balloons which disappeared against the nighttime dark. I hope everyone who saw them became the figures in their minds — either flying above the playa, or dreaming about it.\n\nDutch artist Dadara brought his “Checkpoint Dream Yourtopia” to the playa for 2008’s American Dream theme; he managed to combine politics and dreaming in one impressive, interactive installation. A border control checkpoint, where one could enter the world of his/her own dreams, demonstrated that crossing real borders between countries can be a difficult task, and that crossing the boundaries inside one’s own heart and life might mean a big leap into the unknown.\n\nDreamers Present\n\nSeveral artists are bringing work inspired by this year’s Waking Dreams theme.\n\n“A Thousand Eyes” by Miguel Guzman and Iyvone Khoo presents trilobites, those fanciful prehistoric creatures. Trilobites were some of the earliest life forms with complex ‘eyes.’ Because of their sight, they symbolize our most ancient visions, the first dreamers. “Dreaming awake, walking in a desert, where giant luminous trilobites hover across the desert sands,” the artists muse.\n\n“Catharsis” by Arthur Mamou-Mani and the Catharsis Crew is a fractal gallery for our infinite dreams. It will provide an infinite space with seven gateways elevating to the sky and getting increasingly intricate and intimate, forming a dream-like set of galleries and spaces for everyone to use and place art of all kinds.\n\n“Dreams: a pop-up book” by Esmeralda is a giant pop-up book. When a reader opens the wooden book, it springs to life. Each turn of the page reveals a new pop-up showing a different dreamscape.\n\n“Sea of Dreams” by The Flaming Lotus Girls is an immersive fire sculpture with a story that unfolds even from a distance. Larger-than-life origami boats sail on a pilgrimage toward a central ring of fiery origami cranes. Entrapped in a landscape of their own making, these bold dreamers sail the Black Rock Sea to pay homage to the Elders and release their illusions as blossoms of flame blooming into the void.",
