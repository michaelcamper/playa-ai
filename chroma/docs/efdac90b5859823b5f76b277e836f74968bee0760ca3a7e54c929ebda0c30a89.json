  "content": "TL;DR\n\nBlack Rock City passed the 2024 BLM Post-Event Inspection! We achieved our best inspection score since the near-perfect results of 2019, a remarkable comeback after the torrential rain and MOOP (Matter Out of Place) challenges of 2023. However, Playa Restoration’s 2024 MOOP Map highlights a persistent issue: lag bolts and tent stakes left behind, which require immediate community action. As we gear up for BRC 2025 and the #bestburnever, let’s take a moment to look back on and learn from 2024.\n\nNo Matter Out of Place\n\nWith over 70,000 participants, Leaving No Trace relies on a commitment from the entire community. Black Rock City’s undefeated BLM inspection record is a testament to the dedication of participants, with Playa Restoration providing essential follow-up to ensure that we leave the desert clean and beautiful.\n\n(Video by Martin Rodriguez)\n\nMOOP Map 2024: A Clean Sweep!\n\nThe 2024 Burning Man event in Black Rock City saw the community step up our Leave No Trace efforts—camps were cleaner, departures more organized, and participants conducted Matter Out of Place (MOOP) sweeps and DIY MOOP tests. Amazing work! These efforts helped Playa Restoration successfully sweep over 3,700 acres.\n\nThe 2024 MOOP Map reflects noticeable improvements, especially in the back city blocks, which had been more impacted in previous years. The majority of the city was impressively clean, though some red areas still required focused attention.\n\nPlaya Restoration’s role is to fine-tune and finalize our collective effort. In preparation for the BLM Post-Inspection, Resto’s Test Team conducted pre-inspection MOOP tests (represented by blue dots on the MOOP Map) to gauge progress. Thanks to Resto’s final concentrated push, Black Rock City achieved its best Post-Event Inspection score since the record-breaking 2019 season. This success underscores the power of a united community, the dedication of Playa Restoration, and our shared commitment to Leaving No Trace. The 2024 win belongs to the entire community—every camp, participant, and team that showed up to Leave No Trace.\n\nBLM Post-Event Site Inspection Standard\n\nOn October 7, 2024, the BLM conducted its annual inspection. Only three of the 120 test points exceeded the standard, all within the city grid (Esplanade to K Street, 2:00 to 10:00). This was a marked improvement from 2023, when 11 test points failed, putting us dangerously close to the 10% limit.\n\nAdditionally, six specific Points of Interest are under repeat observation and calculated separately, including Man Base, the Temple, and several others. Of these, only one exceeded the standard.\n\nResto Calls Out LAG BOLTS/TENT STAKES as #1 Worst MOOP (Again)!\n\nDespite our overall improvement, with 1,508 recorded instances this year, LAG BOLTS/TENT STAKES remain the worst MOOP and most dangerous again. Unfortunately, the numbers have shown little improvement from previous years despite repeated warnings.\n\nRecorded instances of lag bolts/tent stakes rose from 101 in 2019 to 1,023 in 2022, peaking at 1,547 in 2023, and slightly dropping to 1,508 in 2024. These figures, based on GPS data, likely underestimate the total.\n\nTips for Stake Removal\n\nAll spikes put in the ground must be accounted for and removed by the participant, camp, or project that placed them.\n\nMoving forward, the Placement team, Art Department, and Resto will work with participants to refine their Leave No Trace plans. We’ll assess MOOP sweeps, pre-departure MOOP tests, and ensure stakes and lag bolts are accounted for and removed.\n\nBurning Man has always been a proving ground for what’s possible when our community comes together with intention. Let’s have a blast and make 2025 the year we leave no doubt by leaving no trace (and no lag bolts!), keeping the Black Rock Desert clean and beautiful—Tomorrow Today!",
