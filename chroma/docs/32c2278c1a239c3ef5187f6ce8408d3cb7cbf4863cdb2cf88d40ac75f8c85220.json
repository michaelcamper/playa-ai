  "content": "Ever since SXSW was a small gathering of creative types back in the day, we’ve sent folks from BMHQ down to Austin to participate. Over the years, we’ve hosted (or were on) a number of panels, held some workshops, and did a heck of a lot of connecting with like-minded people. And it’s funny … one of the most common questions we get is why we’re there. Why would Burning Man do SXSW?\n\nWell, during our 25+ years of producing Burning Man, we’ve learned a thing or two about collaborative creation, participation-driven cities, inspiring creativity, creating crucibles for innovation, alternative socioeconomic models — things that we’re as eager to share with the broader creative community as they are to hear it. So for us, it’s as much about skill sharing as learning and community engagement.\n\nSo … that said, we’re happy to once again be sending a small contingent from Burning Man HQ to participate in SXSWi this year.\n\nRosie von Lila has put together a pretty impressive group of panelists to discuss participatory cities on March 14, and Burning Man Founder and CEO Marian Goodell will be on a panel about creating a space for social good on March 15.\n\nWe’ve also coordinated a couple Burner meet-ups, one for Austin Burners on March 14, and another for SXSW badge-holders on March 15. Details below … and if you’re in Austin during SXSW, we hope to see you!\n\nPanel: Participatory Cities: Inspiring Access and Action\nAustin Convention Center, Room 10AB, 500 E Cesar Chavez St.\nSat, Mar 14, 12:30-1:30pm\n\nPanel: Sandbox Stories, Creating a Space for Social Good\nBurning Man Founder & CEO Marian Goodell, panelist\nSun, Mar 15, 9:30-10:30am\nAustin City Hall, Council Chambers, 301 W 2nd St\n\nBadge Holder Meetup: SXSW Burning Man Meetup\nSun, Mar 15, 5-6pm\nJW Marriott, Room 508, 110 E 2nd St (SXSW badge required)\n\nPublic Meetup for Austin Burners and Wannabe Burners (please spread widely!)\nFriends in Austin! Please join folks from Burning Man HQ for an informal Austin Burners (and wannabe Burners) meet-up — come say hi and shoot the breeze. We’ll be in the back yard of Justine’s, just far enough away from the SXSW craziness. We’d love to see you!\nSaturday, March 14, 5:30 pm\nJustine’s Brasserie\n4710 E 5th St, Austin, TX 78702\n(512) 385-2900",
