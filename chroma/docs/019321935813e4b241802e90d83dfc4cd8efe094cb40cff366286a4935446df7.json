  "content": "Our annual convergence in Black Rock City represents many things to many people. A pilgrimage to some, a party to others, and a wild spectacle of art and humanity to us all, this year’s event will also offer a chance to learn from several communities coming to Black Rock City to share their experiences battling marginalization and violence.\n\nAmong camps whose programming reflects a deep commitment to social justice and inclusion, several are featuring workshops and events to bring together Burners and activists building a brighter tomorrow. For instance, indigenous water protectors from Standing Rock will be featured at Red Lightning, alongside sacred fire, a medicine council, and a global drum prayer on Tuesday at 6:30 pm.\n\nOther camps presenting workshops and the chance to learn about the lives and concerns of communities battling longstanding oppression include Que Viva, Gender Blender, and TransFOAMation.\n\nQue Viva\n\nQue Viva (at Rod’s Road & 3:30, near 5:30 & A) is a camp composed of activists building the movements for black lives and immigrant rights, convened by Oakland artist Favianna Rodriguez. The camp is hosting a series of workshops on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, in addition to social events on Wednesday and Friday.\n\nOn Tuesday from noon to 2:00, the camp will host an art workshop building butterfly wings while learning about migration. On Wednesday from 1:00 to 3:00, Que Viva will host a racial justice chat to help Burners learn how to be an effective ally to communities of color vulnerable to law enforcement abuses. And on Thursday from 3:00 to 4:30, they’ll host a discussion about whether “black lives really matter… beyond the hashtag.”\n\nParties at Que Viva include a Wednesday celebration from 5:30 to 7:30 for multiracial Burners, as well as a Selena & Sangria party on Friday from 3:00 to 5:00. The camp’s founder, Favianna, explains the vision behind Que Viva in this video:\n\nGender Blender and TransFOAMation\n\nAnother camp presenting stories from marginalized communities is Gender Blender (7:45 & E), which is teaming up with TransFOAMation (2:00 & E) to highlight the experiences of people defining their gender in terms beyond the binary.\n\nGender Blender started in 2009, co-created by Ariel Vegosen and Ronnie Appleseed to address the lack of safe space for gender non-conformists both on and off the playa, as well as a desire to celebrate all identities and provide space for people of all backgrounds to explore and expand their respective conceptions of gender expression.\n\nGender Blender is committed to creating community on the playa and beyond. Gender Blender has sponsored the SF Trans March since 2014, participated in its resource fair, and supports Blenders facilitating discussions and education around gender issues across California, in Washington D.C., New York, and even internationally in Canada, Greece and Mexico. Gender Blender also runs an Oakland-based safer-space consent-focused play party (with music sometimes provided by your correspondent).\n\nThis year, Gender Blender has teamed up with TransFOAMation to bring gender expansion, playfulness, mind and heart opening, gender inclusion, gender education, and an amazing perFOAMance to the masses! TransFOAMation has served the playa for many years under different names each year, with a signature experience involving soap-foam showers and a daytime dance party every day from Wednesday to Saturday from noon to 4:20.\n\nIn 2017, TransFOAMation will honor Trans and gender-queer ancestors who paved the way for us to enjoy a more accepting and free culture. We still have a long way to go to ensure equal rights and full inclusion for all people regardless of gender expression, and TransFOAMation is showing how to do that on playa.\n\nWorkshops at Gender Blender include a session on “radical inclusion from rituals to the mundane,” on Tuesday from 2:30 to 4:30, and a workshop on “building resilience in our activist communities” on Thursday from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm.\n\nOther events at Gender Blender include a play party on Wednesday from 9:00 pm to 2:00 am, preceded by libations starting at 7:30, and a party for the Queerborhood on Friday from 3:00 to 6:00 pm, beginning with camp founder Ariel’s “Burn Mitzvah” from 2:00 to 3:00 pm (at which your correspondent will be playing music).\n\nOur time in the desert can build both community and consciousness. This year, take a moment on the playa to broaden your horizons by learning how our work liberating ourselves and each other can take shape off the playa with Que Viva, Gender Blender, and TransFOAMation.\n\nTop photo by Tony Edwards",
