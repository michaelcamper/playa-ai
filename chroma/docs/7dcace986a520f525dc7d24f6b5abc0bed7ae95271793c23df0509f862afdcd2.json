  "content": "We’ve been out here for almost two weeks now, and with the exception of a burn barrel here and there, we haven’t seen much fire. So naturally we were drawn to the flames the other night when we saw the bright light down by the Depot.\n\nIt wasn’t really anything special, just the accumulated burnables of a couple of days. The two Mikes were down at the Depot this evening, Rest Stop Buddy and Alipato.\n\nIt was quiet. Gameshow was inside getting pimped out for the boys and girls social. There wasn’t much chatter on the radio. We hung out and had a few beers.\n\n“I’m a little suspicious of you,” Alipato said, looking sideways at me.. “The blogger doing the organization’s bidding. … It could just be my normal paranoia though.”\n\nNomad came walking by, on his way to the social. “Be home by 10,” Rest Stop said.\n\nThe night was absolutely gorgeous. Calm, warm, quiet.\n\n“The biggest and earliest camp hasn’t arrived yet,” Alipato said.\n\n“Which one is that?” I asked.\n\n“Camp Woo Woo,” he said.\n\n“Who are they?”\n\n“Well, we’ve been out here awhile now,” Alipato said. “We’ve accilmated. But pretty soon the big camps will arrive, and you’ll here the people hootin’ and hollering, going ‘Woo! Woo!’ … They’re so happy to be here. The air really carries the sound. It’ll sound like coyotes, and Camp Woo Woo will be here.”\n\nWe were talking about how much time we’ve spent on the playa, and Alipato did some figuring and realized that when you totaled it all up, he’d spent most of a year here.\n\n“That’s a little scary,” he said.\n\nWhen he’s not doing the Burning Man thing, Alipato works the Oregon Country Fair with Gameshow and a few others here. “There’s a lot of crossover,” he said.\n\nThen it got chilly and late, and it was time to go. Don’t tell anyone, but they signed out a bag of ice for me.\n\nSo see you soon, Camp Woo Woo. Light the fire.",
