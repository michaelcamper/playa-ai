  "content": "Main Sale day is always a bittersweet day for us. Even if everything goes perfectly, it still results in many disappointed Burners not yet having secured a ticket to BRC.\n\nPlease know that we see the hurt and frustration out there. We do our best to keep the system as fair as possible — actively intercepting bad actors who attempt to exploit our community by creating bogus registrations to sell, or bots trying to get into the sale. It’s not easy, and we do catch these situations and shut them down as they are identified. If this were just about selling tickets, we wouldn’t bother with any of that. But obviously, this is about so much more.\n\nAt the end of the day, a lot of dyed-in-the-wool Burners will be caught for a while longer in that uncomfortable liminal space between their playa-intentions and default-world logistics. For those folks we ask for everyone to be as kind and understanding as possible. Know a friend with an extra, or whose plans have changed? Reach out.\n\nTo those who don’t get tickets in the Main Sale, please don’t give up. There are still options coming up, including the Secure Ticket Exchange Program (STEP) and OMG. (Full info on those over on the Tickets website.) But the absolute best way to find yourself a ticket? By engaging with your local Burner community and getting involved. Burning Man tickets have a way of finding people who need them, no matter what happened in the sale. Put yourself out there, make connections, offer to help, and see what happens — that is the ultimate Burning Man experience!\n\nIt may not offer much comfort right now, but please remember that Burning Man exists all year-long, all around the world — being a part of Burning Man is in no way contingent on having a ticket to BRC every year.\n\nWhether it’s at a local Regional Event, at a community service event, a maker workshop, or covered in playa dust, we look forward to seeing you soon.\n\n(Top photo by Robert Bruce Anderson)",
