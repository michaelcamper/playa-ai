  "content": "For JB.\n\n1.\n\nOn the edge of the sunlight\nI stopped. I thought I saw you in the shimmer.\nBefore me endlessness; endlessness behind,\nThe Playa baked flat in a lunar meringue\nStamped down by the feet of all those who had come before, and dreamt,\nAnd sang their ancient songs to the stars.\n\nBut no, you weren’t there.\n\nI pushed back off into the parched and brutal air,\nPedals wheezing like landed fish,\nPast images of beauty and visions of the damned.\nA giant scorpion. Temple of Memories.\nBaby Jesus eating Ben and Jerry’s from a cone.\nAnd how exactly do you adopt a gnome?\nEach one a different world, a silent wow,\nWhich only the wide eyed child in us can know,\nUntil I reached The Man.\nFaceless, he stood facing the City\nUnder the relentless blue of the sky.\nAn empty vessel to fill, a blank page on which all our histories will be written,\nAll our hopes and fears,\nThe thick dust of our significant insignificance.\n\nLive well knowing you will die\nLive well knowing you will die\n\n2.\n\nOn the edge of the firelight\nI stopped, and thought I heard you call me by my name.\nNameless voices swirled around me in a thousand tongues\nEach muttering their prayers and curses before this altar of fire\nEach gazing on The Man’s blank pain\nHis martyr’s arms raised high against the hiss of flames.\n\nBut no, you weren’t there.\n\nA sudden crack of muscle and snap of bone\nAnd The Man stumbles, goes down into the fiery heart.\nA cheer goes up.\nAnd the City runs forward to meet its future,\nEach Citizen searching in the white heat for the one true thing.\nSome dance naked, bodies golden in the glow.\nOthers drum or chant or stare.\nA woman, unreachable, beats out her agony with sweaty fists.\nNearby a brass band plays – Basin Blues from a tuba on fire!\nI circle the fire, my face ablaze, eyeballs boiling in their sockets\nAnd gaze at where He once stood.\nBut all I see is that moment before, when He stretched out his arms.\nWas it defiance or surrender? I don’t know.\nA fatal embrace or a setting free?\nWhich one is it? Must I decide?\nIs this the phoenix rising or a funeral pyre?\nSudden tears sting my eyes.\nAround me, a million tiny sparks shoot up into the night sky.\n\nLive well knowing you will die\nLive well knowing you will die.\n\n3.\n\nOn the edge of the moonlight,\nI stopped, and thought I felt your heart beat beneath my hand.\nYour body shifts and turns, stubble rubbing hard on my chest.\nAwakes.\nA smile comes out of the darkness.\nThe glowsticks on your wrists look like slipped halos from fallen angels,\nghostly hoops touched by the divine.\nOutside the tent the City’s alive with pleasure.\n\nAnd yes, we have all that in here.\n\nDawn creeps, then rushes to be done,\nThe sun leaping up over the horizon.\nBut no Man this time to greet it and salute the new day, risen from the ashes.\nNo still point of a turning world,\nExcept for me.\nI feel the stillness now, this gift you have given me.\nYou are my history. You are my future. Hopes and fears.\nNow you are all my significant insignificance.\nYou laugh out loud.\nI know you think I’m ridiculous and so do I.\nBut then you pause; you reach up to kiss me; you let me dive deep, deep into\nyour dark brilliance,\nYour wrists glowing softly as you whisper in my ear.\n\nLive well knowing you will die\nLive well knowing you will die\n\nby Nicholas McInerny",
