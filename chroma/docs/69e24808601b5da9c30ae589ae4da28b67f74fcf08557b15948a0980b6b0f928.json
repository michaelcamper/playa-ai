It tells the story of how sustainability projects are coming to life and highlights some of the technology being used to make it happen. As we set our sights on Black Rock City 2023, we hope this beautiful film inspires Burners around the world to imagine how we can continue to create the greenest event possible, together. For more on the topic of sustainability and Burning Man, check out our sustainability webpage and watch the latest sustainability report update.\n\nEnjoy this piece from the film’s executive producer and multi-year Burner, Mona Wu.\n\n“Tales of Dreamers”: A Journey of Transformation and Sustainability\n\nBy Mona Wu\n\nWelcome to the story of “Tales of Dreamers,” a unique cinematic exploration of the annual Burning Man event, where the unique blend of dreams, creativity, and sustainable living intertwine.\n\n​​After the pandemic’s imposed hiatus, we found ourselves in search of a story — a narrative still evolving, one offering comfort and brimming with hope. Burning Man is often tied to a wild variety of notions, but due to its transient nature, sustainability is not the first connection many people make. Upon embarking on our sixth film, a question arose: “Is this event truly sustainable, and does it justify its existence in our world for the long run?” Driven by the sustainability theme, this question resounds throughout our documentary, “Tales of Dreamers.”\n\nThe film crew set off for our longest journey in Black Rock City, a full 14-day immersion, to trace the budding commitment of both the Burning Man organization and Black Rock City participants towards sustainability. We explore sustainable practices adopted by participants and event organizers, showcasing how small steps can contribute to a larger movement of environmental stewardship. You will see artists who prioritize the use of reclaimed wood as their primary resource, alongside international artists who locally source materials to minimize their carbon footprint. You’ll also learn about theme camps transitioning to solar power in place of generators, and Burners’ passion for constructing their infrastructure purely with wooden joinery.\n\nOf course, the journey wasn’t without its challenges. Much like many of us returning after a long break, we felt a bit rusty. We battled dust storms and heat, experienced an anticipated art burn fizzling out, and found that some panel discussions fell short of our expectations. Yet, we were heartened by a number of dedicated Burners who, in the face of these obstacles, walk steadily on the path towards a more sustainable Burn. While our film does not seek to provide a definitive answer, we aim to spark dialogue and raise awareness about sustainability within the context of Burning Man.\n\nIn our documentary, “Tales of Dreamers,” I warmly invite every one of you to join us on an adventurous expedition. Together, we will unveil the secrets of a more sustainable Burn. So buckle up, and get ready to be thrilled, inspired and enlightened on this exciting journey!\n\nAll images courtesy of the artist, Mona Wu",
