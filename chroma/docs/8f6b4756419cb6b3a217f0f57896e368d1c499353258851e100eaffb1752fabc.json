  "content": "The stakes are in, the fence is strung and the flags are flapping in the breeze. All that’s missing is a line of cars and vans and RVs a couple of miles long, and things would look like opening day.\n\nThe sense of anticipation here is building, even though there’s a certain serenity to the Gate scene now.\n\nLast night the Gate crew held a fence-tying party. Everyone was invited to participate, in return for copious amounts of beer and whisky. Wild Child reported this morning that he’d never seen a jankier fence, but thanked everyone for helping anyway.",
