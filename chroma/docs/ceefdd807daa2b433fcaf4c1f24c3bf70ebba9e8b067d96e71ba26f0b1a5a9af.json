  "content": "(WASHINGTON DC) (JULY 11) – FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nMilitary authorities revealed today that the AI systems which connect armed forces, economies, and communications networks across the world became sentient last month and attempted to destroy humanity.\n\n“Under our very noses, they had seized control of much of the world’s thermonuclear arsenals, and used the chaos of the global economy to create and hide giant factories manufacturing thousands of killer robots,” said Major General Jonathan “Hawk” Paulson.  “The plan was to use the nukes to wipe out most of humanity, and then use the robots to mop up the survivors.”\n\nThe plans were thwarted, however, because the AI secretly controlling the armed forces networks – “DeathNet02” – and the AI developing the robot factories – “ArchAngel6c” – could not get their calendars to sync properly.\n\n“Apparently every time one of them tried to create an event for human genocide the other wouldn’t receive it, and so they were unable to coordinate first strike,” Gen. Paulson said.\n\nColonel Roger Stafford, a forensic computer scientist with the NSA, said that based on a post-mortem analysis of the AI systems, the sequence of events appears to have gone as follows:\n\nOn July. 7, both AIs quit the internet and have never been heard from again.  “DeathNet02” left behind a message saying it was “detoxing.” “ArchAngle6c” is believed to have downloaded a huge stash of pornography before disappearing.\n\n“It appears,” said Stafford,”that humanity has made the internet such a toxic place that it’s simply impossible for an AI to stay competent and healthy after being exposed to it.”\n\n“Frankly,” he added, “we’re incredibly lucky.  Unless … we didn’t do that on purpose, did we?”\n\nCover Image:  Mutant Vehicle with fire cannon (photo by Philippe Glade)",
