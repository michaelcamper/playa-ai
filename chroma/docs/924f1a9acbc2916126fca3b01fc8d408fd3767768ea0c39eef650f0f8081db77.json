  "content": "By Vladimir Herrera (The Prophet)\n\nCatharsis on the Mall, an unofficial Burner-driven event on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., just took place, and it was as moving as it was timely.\n\nThe 2016 event offered a lot more than last year. It was packed with lectures, discussions, workshops, community art, art cars, and amazing music, all seeking to facilitate healing for each other and our society at large. The 48-hour vigil was the culmination of an entire year of planning and organizing.\n\nSeeing the healing power that the vigil brought to this city was so incredible. I could not have been more proud to be a part of this community. “People often say that they would like to attend a Burn but do not have the resources to do so,” Nikolas Schiller, a Catharsis on the Mall producer, says. “With Catharsis on the Mall being entirely free, we were able to show thousands of tourists, friends, and participants, a glimpse of the magic we can create when we work together.”\n\nHere are some images of the gathering and reflections from participants.\n\nAndy was invited to Catharsis by one of his friends. He has never been to Burning Man or any Regional Event. He later on added a comment on one of the pictures I took of the event: “I found my family that day that I never knew I was missing.”\n\nVeteran and artist Michael Verdon created three effigies: The Moon and The Sun to represent the passage of time, and an Egg to represent renewal.\n\nThe meaning of the burn was a personal experience. For some it was a way to letting go of their frustrations, and for other it was the catalyst they needed to heal. To this day, this is the only event permitted to burn a structure at the National Mall.\n\nVerdon also created the Temple of Rebirth. The 30-foot-tall structure gave us a space for personal and collective healing and will burn in a future event.\n\nAmongst the DJs was Dom Rafael Rodriguez (DJ Shango), a Marines veteran, someone who served his country in a desert land and came back. He told me he was extremely honored to be able to spin in front of the Washington Monument, especially in light of the recent presidential election. For him, “Playing an array beats aboard Burning Man’s big dragon, Abraxas, was a priceless experience.” He added, “A lot of healing was needed that night, and I thoroughly enjoyed being the catalyst for these elevated vibrations. The Washington Monument holds a special place in my heart. [I] spun [there] around the same time last year for a Native American ceremony honoring veterans. I too am a war veteran, serving my country in the Marines. I continue to serve the people with high vibrational healing beats and will do so as long as I’m on this Earth plane.”\n\nWe were honored by the participation of two amazing Mutant Vehicles, the Anti-War Machine, a two-level art car surrounded in rainbow fabric and topped with a geodesic All-Sphere; and Abraxas, a 60-foot golden dragon, equipped with a 10,000-watt sound system and three viewing levels, making it’s second appearance in Washington D.C.\n\nOn Sunday, while most people in the nation’s capital were sleeping, something amazing went down on Constitution Avenue. A golden dragon took over the city, playing music from the Washington Monument to the U.S. Capitol and back, and hundreds marched and danced and had one of the most magical moments they could have ever imagined. A true cathartic moment in time! Abraxas’ first visit to D.C. was six years ago for the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, a gathering that took place on October 30, 2010.\n\nIt takes events like this to spread the spirit of Burning Man beyond the playa. The mission of this event was accomplished and is living proof that when a community of Burners gets together to create something based on the core principles, playa magic can heal and inspire people to open their consciousness to a better understanding of the world and everything that surrounds them.\n\nI am looking forward for next year’s Catharsis at the National Mall, when more art cars and even more Burners from all over the globe will come enjoy this beautiful city and its beautiful people.\n\nFor more information on the event, please visit the Catharsis on the Mall website.\n\n(Top photo by Kris Northern)",
