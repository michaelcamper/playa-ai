  "content": "If you’ve been to a Burning Man event anywhere, chances are you came home with a pocket full of wonderful gifts. Burners love to make and share jewelry, tchotchkes, costumes and all manner of printed creations. Burning Man Project and our wildly creative community have produced quite the volume of archival materials over our 36 years of existence; most of our archives are at Burning Man Project Headquarters (HQ) in San Francisco, California. There are also several growing collections at libraries and museums, some of which are publicly accessible.\n\nArchives at Burning Man Project Headquarters\n\nBurning Man HQ is home to six archives and is a veritable museum of Burning Man history, filled with wondrous displays of art, photography and ephemera.\n\nBurning Man Archives and Collections at Libraries and Museums\n\nAs Burning Man Project’s archivist, I gather and catalogue Burning Man’s archival materials and ephemera, and work with museums and libraries to donate collections and curate exhibits. I recently donated my 26 years of archival materials to the San Francisco Public Library History Center, where anyone interested can walk in and request to see them.\n\nThe Nevada Museum of Art (NMA) in Reno has a large Burning Man archive, originally donated by Burning Man Co-founder Michael Mikel and then added to by many others. Later this year I’ll be donating my 26 year playa jewelry collection, plus prints, documents and photographs, to the NMA.\n\nIn addition, Nora Atkinson of the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian will soon select playa jewelry to be housed in the new wing being built for their permanent collection, opening in 2024.\n\nLearn more about the Burning Man Archives:",
