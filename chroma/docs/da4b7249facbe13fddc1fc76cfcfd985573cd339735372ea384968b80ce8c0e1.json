  "content": "For a lot of people, Burning Man is a transformational experience.\n\nYour outlook changes. Your experience of the world changes. The way you relate to other people, and the place they hold in your life, changes.\n\nStories of transformations are everywhere.\n\nThere is the business executive who, after attending his first Burn, decided that the life he was leading really wasn’t the right one for him, so he chucked his job and his status and went on the road for a year and a half, trying to decide what to do next with his life. (This story is not apocryphal; ; I am not making it up. True, I can’t use the names, but you can probably understand the reasons why.)\n\nThere is the young woman who went to Burning Man after graduating from college and decided, “Oh yes, this is for me, this is how I want to develop my life, these are the areas where I want to grow.” So she moved to San Francisco, to be in  position to volunteer for the organization. She’s still here.\n\nAnd then there are the smaller, maybe less dramatic things that happen to you during the event, the ones that you try to take back from the playa with you. The experiences you didn’t know you needed to have until you actually had them. Somehow, you met and had a truly significant and helpful conversation with a person who was going through something a lot like what you’re going through. You found new words to describe your situation, and in the process, discovered more clearly how you were feeling about it. And how exactly did it happen that this was the person you were stranded with in a sandstorm? How exactly did that awesome conversation start?\n\nIt’s lost in the haze, but the aftereffects have lingered.\n\nTell us about how you’ve changed since the time in the desert, and how you got to where you are now.",
