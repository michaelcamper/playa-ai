  "content": "Black Rock City is a living manifestation of Burning Man culture, and the act of collaboratively building the city renews our hope, connection, and excitement. With nearly 70,000 participants this year, wow, did Black Rock City deliver! The way we gather offers a great reminder of why more Burning Man is needed.\n\nFostering interactions, innovation, and community based on shared experiences, Burning Man is the antidote to the division, hostility, isolation and conformity we see too often in the world.\n\nBurning Man is more relevant than ever and global participation is at a record high, but 2024 Black Rock City tickets in the higher price tiers did not sell as planned. The resulting revenue shortfall means everything is now at risk. In fact, when compared to 2023, the revenue shortfall from the higher price tiers was approximately $5.7 million. This is only representative of a portion of what we must raise in 2024. More than an event, Burning Man is a global cultural movement, and the nonprofit in service to that culture requires year-round support — year after year.\n\nEvery dollar helps! Just like other cultural and arts nonprofits, including your local symphony or theater company, Burning Man Project depends on the generosity and support of its community members to accomplish its mission. Ticket revenue alone does not fund all that Burning Man Project does to bring Burning Man to the world, including the production of Black Rock City, and in fact has not since 2014. This is why whether you went to BRC this year or not, you are a member of our community, and a monthly contribution of $20 will help to keep Burning Man programs alive. Without corporate sponsorships — which we’ve never had and will never have — to underwrite our operations, we are increasingly reliant on philanthropy (including your generous purchases of those higher-priced Black Rock City tickets).\n\nWe are taking steps to focus our operations for the future, and need the community’s help to raise the funds needed to preserve Black Rock City as the vibrant heart of Burning Man, and protect the culture with which the event is inextricably intertwined.\n\nThe power of the Burning Man community is incredible — we come together, do hard things and overcome challenges head-on. We got through a rain event, we’ve battened down through dust storms, and we’ve even navigated a pandemic together.\n\nWith your help, we will accomplish what is good for the world, save the future of Black Rock City and continue to get more Burning Man out there. Consistent with our 10 Principles, your generous participation and gifting is what sparks the Burning Man flame.\n\nMy hope is for you to be the spark for more Burning Man, and I invite you to be a part of co-creating the future. I look forward to your involvement.\n\nIf your friendships, community, family or personal life have benefited or could benefit from the magic, creativity and inspiration of Burning Man, I urge you to please support us with a gift today.",
