  "content": "As Burners, some like to wish each other a happy new year when the Man burns at the end of our annual Burn Week. This sense of closure and new beginnings often kicks off new friendships, dreams, and collaborations. Wherever and however you participated in Burn Week this year — virtually, in the desert, or with your home community — you may be looking for ways to keep the fire burning and stay in touch, learn more, or meet new people.\n\nIn spring 2021, we launched a pilot project to spark conversations and projects around four topic areas: sustainability, Radical Inclusion, diversity, and equity (R.I.D.E.), health and safety, and leadership and participation. We invited folks to join groups, converse, and collaborate in our new community space — Burning Man Hive.\n\nAnd yes — YOU are invited to bring your ideas, thoughts, projects, and topics into Hive: join a conversation; follow a course; propose an idea; start a collaboration; create an event; or start your very own Hive group.\n\nThe Hive pilot project this spring was nothing short of Burning Man magic. Participants sparked myriad conversations that evolved into new groups, courses, and topics. You can read a handful of stories from Hive participants in this Journal post.\n\nWe’ve added just a few examples of Hive groups and projects YOU can participate in. New to Hive? Start here.\n\nUpcoming Live Events in Hive:\n\nExamples of Topics to Explore in Hive:\n\nHive Learning Experiences (Courses) Available to You 24/7:\n\nExamples of Hive Groups to Participate in:\n\nWherever you are burning brightly, we hope you’ll join us on Burning Man Hive to connect with fellow Burners, to learn what others are up to, and share your lessons learned. It’s also an awesome place to find collaborators or mentors for projects!",
