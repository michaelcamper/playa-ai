  "content": "Fire and music create a gathering for hundreds of participants each Tuesday and Wednesday night in July as part of Artown. Over 1,000 people gathered at the corner of Sierra Street and Island Ave for the opening of the temporary interactive art installation and performance venue. Hundreds of adults and children have enjoyed the unique experience of controlling a pulsing tower of flame effects while DJ’s spin dance music for the performers and public alike.\nBrought to Reno by the [BRAF] and exhibited at [BM] in 2010, Spire of Fire, by artists Steve Atkins and Eric Smith, towers 48 feet above the Riverwalk. The tower of pulsing flame effects will be the site of continued fire dance performances by Controlled Burn each Tuesday night at 8:30pm, with “Get Hooped” taking over Wednesdays with Velocity Movement and BoHo Hoops. All of the performances are free to the public with Tuesdays featuring a beer and wine garden provided by Wild River Grille.\n“We believe the ongoing exhibition of Spire of Fire during Artown will ignite the community’s passions in many ways,” said Crimson Rose, Member Board of Directors, BRAF and Art Director for Burning Man. “By enhancing civic space through the temporary transformation of an empty lot into an inviting art space and establishing a creative gathering spot for Reno citizens, BRAF continues to bring the culture of Burning Man to downtown Reno for those who have never experienced the event in the desert.”\n\nDuring Artown, fire dancers and spinners from Controlled Burn will entertain Tuesday evenings 8:30pm – 10:00pm.\n\nHula Hoopers from Velocity Movement and BoHo Hoops present “GET HOOPED” at Hoop Jams on Wednesday evenings from 7:00pm-8:30pm. All levels and ages are welcome.\nMark Hammon’s photos of the Spire of Fire Opening\nSpire of Fire photos\nJim Freeman’s from “Downtown Reno” Photos\n\nvideo: Freddy Hahne\nphotos: Mark Hammon",
