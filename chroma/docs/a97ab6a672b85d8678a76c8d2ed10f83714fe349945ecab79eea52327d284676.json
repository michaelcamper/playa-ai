Now you know everything.\n\nHydrology of Playas and the Genesis of Dust\n\nThe relations among playa type, playa hydrology, and surface sediment characteristics are important factors that control the type and amount of dust emitted from playas. The production of evaporite minerals during evaporative loss of near-surface ground water results in both the creation and maintenance of several centimeters or more of loose sediment at wet playas.",
