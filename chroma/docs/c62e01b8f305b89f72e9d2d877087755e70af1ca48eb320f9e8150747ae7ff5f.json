This is the second video update from our CEO Marian Goodell, sharing important news about what’s up with Burning Man Project and Black Rock City.\n\nThere’s lots of Burning Man art out in the world, and we want to help you find it! We just released info about the 2021 Honoraria Art (with pieces being brought to life whether Black Rock City happens or not). You can also check out this fun global Burner Art Safari map from Burning Flipside while you’re at it.\n\nWant to plug into your local Burning Man community? Get involved through the Regional Network and Burners Without Borders.\n\nCheck out Marian’s full video below! Any burning questions? Send them to questions@burningman.org.\n\n(And in case you missed last week’s video update, watch it here now.)",
