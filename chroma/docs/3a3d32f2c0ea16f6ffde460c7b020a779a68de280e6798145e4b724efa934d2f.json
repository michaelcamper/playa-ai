  "content": "“We created The Burning Man Project,” founding board member Harley DuBois told 200 of Burning Man’s regional representatives and community leaders.  “And now we’re figuring out what it is.”\n\nThis was the common refrain among the main speakers from the Burning Man organization at the Global Leadership Conference.  After 25 years we’ve gotten “here” – and perhaps from this vantage point we can figure out where “here” is.\n\n“What if we were able to take the network you have (as regionals) and the network BRAF has, and the network that BwB has, and connect them in three dimensions?” asked founding board member Marian Goodell.  “What would that look like?  What would that be?  How would that work?”\n\nShe didn’t have answers:  she was asking.\n\nMore personally, “The six founders are figuring out how we fit in,” DuBois said.  “You’re trying to figure out how you fit in.”\n\nThe crowd of Burners from around the world was overwhelmingly okay with this:  they were even appreciative of the fact that the Burning Man Org isn’t pretending to have more answers than it does.  That we’re in new territory, and exploring it together.\n\nI’d like to take this a step further, though, and say that – contrary to the way we conventionally think of organizational development – this isn’t a problem that we’ll ever work through.  It’s a sign that we’re doing something right.\n\nIf it weren’t this way … if we knew exactly what we were doing and what it would look like and how it would work … we wouldn’t really be trying to live up to Burning Man’s potential.  We’d be settling.\n\nBurning Man has been so remarkable precisely because it has always attempted to reach beyond our capacity to understand what we’re doing.   To take us into territory we know is out there, but haven’t explored.\n\nConsider:  Why is it so hard to describe what Burning Man is to people who haven’t attended?  (Or, often, even to people who have?)   Why, after 26 years, an LLC, major media coverage, and a non-profit, haven’t we gotten this down to a few simple key phrases?\n\nWell part of it is that it’s changed so much over that time – and rarely according to plan.  The original “Man” on Baker Beach wasn’t supposed to be a festival.  “Burning Man happened,” Larry Harvey said in his keynote address, “because we were truly inspired by the enthusiasm of strangers.”\n\nIt was an enthusiasm that, even at the beginning, wasn’t reaching for a carefully calibrated explanation.  “Nobody in that first crew of people who lifted the Man up ever asked ‘what does it mean?’” Harvey recalled.  It was something they felt in their bones, something that pulled them even as they lifted, inspiring rather than articulating.\n\nThat spirit, more than anything, has been what’s kept Burning Man so vital over the years.  The fact that we’re reaching for something that inspires rather than articulates, and that we don’t know where it’s going, allows Burning Man to be more than it was the previous year … and more than we expect it to be tomorrow.  We can let it (meaning “everyone in it,” meaning “you” and “me”) surprise us.  We are pursuing the ineffable, and if pursuing the ineffable does anything, it allows you room to improve.\n\nNow, there are many things this pursuit  isn’t.  It isn’t an excuse for a lack of rigor.  Just as porta-potties have to be delivered on time and cleaned regularly … just as permits with the BLM need to be filed with accurate (and presumably quantified) information … so the various components of the Burning Man Project need to be transparent in their definition and roles, need to work together with clear lines of communication and accountability.\n\nToo often the pursuit of the inexpressible has been used as an excuse for developing the unworkable.  We have to be better than that.\n\nIt’s also not an excuse to put off difficult conversations about the realities of the world:  especially about money.  Yes, Burning Man considers “decommodification” to be among the 10 most important things in the world … but it also needs to be self-sufficient.  It needs to have facilities, it needs to have staff, it needs to exist in the world – even if it’s trying to use the tools of the world to create something better.  The fact that it has higher aspirations is no excuse for Burning Man to either ignore the need for money, or to refuse to talk about it openly and honestly with those who have questions.  “One of the great challenges is how do we deal with the issue of money,” Harvey told the crowd.  “We’ve got to grow up about this.”\n\nUltimately the fact that Burning Man is, at the end of the day, actively pursuing something that is immediate, perhaps even transcendent – that goes past our ability to summarize and graph and replicate – isn’t an excuse for anything.  Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise, who claims that their management practices shouldn’t be reviewed for best practices or their books not looked at for cooking because of their higher aspirations, is selling something past its aspiration date.  Burning Man, either as LLC or 501(c)3 or big thing in the desert or culture, must never make that excuse.\n\nBut our pursuit of the ineffable is a fact.  We’re not reaching for something that’s easy to grasp:  we’re always aiming to make room for something we could not expect.  Even articulate.\n\nThat means we’re going to constantly find ourselves exactly where we are now:  saying “here’s what we’ve got, here’s the direction we’re moving in, we’re still figuring out what it is.”  We’re going to be in this position year after year so long as we are chasing something bigger, more interesting, and harder to describe, than, “camping” or “a rave.”\n\nWe’re going to find ourselves, just like Burning Man’s board right now, saying “I don’t know” a lot.\n\nBut that’s okay.  Because it’s only when we put the clear and defined expectations of the world down that we have room for something more.   That we have room for Bliss Dance, or a giant scrap-metal octopus no one knew about emerging out of the darkness, breathing fire;  or magical serendipity.  You can’t have extraordinary serendipity if everything is scheduled out.\n\n“I don’t know” … so long as it’s not an excuse for anything … is a source of our strength, and what’s kept it worth coming back to year after year. It is also the nature of the ineffable to be ineffable:  those who seek an experience beyond conventional language (or reality?) should not be ungrateful when they find one.  It’s a burden we take on willingly, even joyfully.\n\nWe got here because that inspires people.  To keep that up, we have to keep moving into unknown territory.  I fully expect, a year from now at the next Global Leadership Conference, that we will have as many new questions about Burning Man as answers, and as many new opportunities to say “I don’t know” and “we’re going to figure this out together.”\n\nCaveat is the Volunteer Coordinator for Media Mecca at Burning Man.  His opinions are in no way statements of the Burning Man organization.  Contact him at Caveat (at) Burningman.com.",
