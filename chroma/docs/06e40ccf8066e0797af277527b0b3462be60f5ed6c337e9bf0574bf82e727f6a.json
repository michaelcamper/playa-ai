Did you know that your impact on local economies is HUGE? In fact, Burning Man estimates that in 2011 participants spent over $15 million in Northern Nevada, a region especially hard-hit by the ongoing recession. Many local businesses will tell you that Burning Man season is even bigger than Christmas. Pretty amazing, really.\n\nSocial Capital\n\nThe Burning Man experience has inspired many of us to take a serious look at our financial choices and relationships, including the effects of our economic decisions, directing our money towards resources and businesses that align with our values. By doing so, we invest in social capital. And because of Burning Man’s influence, many local businesses are giving additional attention to social capital and how it impacts the way they do business.\n\nA good example of this is the businesses that participate in the Exodus Trash and Recycling Network (EXTRA), now in its sixth year.  EXTRA is a collective of local businesses in the region who provide trash and recycling services 24/7 to Burners after the event.  The funds raised go back into the community — each of the participating businesses donates funds and materials to local charitable causes, such as Black Rock Solar.\n\nYour Dollars Count\n\nAs you make your travel and shopping plans in the weeks ahead, use the Reno and other Travel Information Pages in the Preparation section of the Burning Man website as a reference.  There you will find very detailed information about our neighboring towns, local businesses that invest in social capital, and Burner-friendly resources to be found on your way to and from Black Rock City.\n\nBy doing your homework and supporting these types of businesses, you’re supporting both our neighbors and Burning Man’s mission (and you’re likely to get some pretty awesome goods and services to boot).\n\nSafe travels!",
