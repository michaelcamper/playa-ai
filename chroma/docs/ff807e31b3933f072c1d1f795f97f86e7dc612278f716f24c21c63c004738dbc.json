  "content": "Announcing the first-ever Tales from the Playa: Live in Black Rock City! Come sit in a soothing installation way out on the edge of BRC to hear and share the dreamiest Burning Man stories.\n\nWhat: Telling Burning Man stories in a far-out vibrating portal\nWhere: 11:55 Reformation Portal, 11:55 & way out there\nWhen: Burning Man 2015: Monday at 9am and 9pm, Friday at 9am and 9pm\n\nPlaya stories aren’t just the what of what happens out there. They’re also the why. The unbelievable events and encounters that happen in BRC become the stories we bring home with us, and they’re the fuel that brings us back. Come share some!\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard stories of the portal? That’s where we’re holding these storytelling sessions. Harlan Emil Gruber’s portals have been the sites of some of my earliest, my wildest, and my most meaningful playa experiences. So, indeed, have Kathy D’Onofrio’s hauntingly beautiful sculptural installations (here’s a great blog post Curt Mekemson wrote about one). So this year, we’re in for a treat, because these two artists are working together. We’ll tell our tales from the playa inside the portal’s humming amplifier, and we’ll have an otherworldly audience of alien beings paying rapt attention.\n\nYou’ve got four chances. Monday and Friday, 9 am and 9 pm. From the Man, aim just a tick to the left of the Temple and walk or bike straight out… way, way out, and you’ll find the encircling walls of the portal. Come on inside, and bring your Burning Man stories.\n\nSee you out there.\n\nTales from the Playa are dreams and memories of events that took place at Burning Man, as told by participants. Submit your story here.",
