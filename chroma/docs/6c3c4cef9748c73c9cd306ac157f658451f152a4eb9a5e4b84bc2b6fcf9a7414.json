We did it.\n\nHere is the hi-resolution MOOP Map for 2019 as well as some educational information about our top MOOP issues.\n\nAbout the MOOP Map\n\nThe MOOP Map is not a shaming mechanism. It’s an educational tool to measure our progress. This is how we learn, hold ourselves accountable, and improve. It’s how we have made it in the desert this far. It simply would not be possible to clean up over 3,600 acres (or 156 million square feet) of the Black Rock Desert, after the Burning Man event, to our high standards if it were not for the combined Leave No Trace endeavor of all our people.\n\nThe 2019 MOOP Map was compiled by the 175 people in the Playa Restoration All-Star Team. As we scoured the playa, we tracked any traces of Matter Out of Place that you may have missed, no matter how small, and cleaned it up.\n\nUsing GPS technology and time stamped photos, the first draft MOOP Map 2019 was colored at the end of each day by the MOOP Scribes and Restoration Managers. Each and every data entry is painstakingly reviewed and verified to its location for the hi-res MOOP Map.\n\nThe MOOP Map colors approximate Resto’s speed and the degree of difficulty:\n\nPre-Test Areas\n\nNew in 2019 was the Test Team. It’s something we’ve been experimenting with over the past few years and now have formalized into a new team within Playa Restoration.  This team goes out to random and targeted areas and tests them against the BLM inspection standard of one square foot per acre by driving a spike into the ground with a 40ft rope attached. The Test Team lines up along that rope and walks in a circle, picking up any MOOP within that 40ft radius.\n\nIn the 2019 MOOP Map, we have depicted the Pre-Test Areas that passed with a Green spiral icon and the fails with a Red spiral icon. The initial results were 172 Green to 34 Red.\n\n2019 MOOP Trends\n\nStreets, Intersection, and Plazas: The Rise of Red\n\nDespite the most Green on the MOOP Map ever, there are still areas of concern, namely the busy streets and intersections which seem to be the majority of the Red this year. When Burning Man happens again, we will not only clean up our camps and art projects but focus our LNT effort on the streets and intersection towards our neighbors across the street and agree to meet in the middle. It could make for a nice social.\n\nTent Stakes and Rebar\n\nIn 2019, the Playa Restoration found removed 101 instances of tent stakes and rebar from the ground surface. Of all the MOOP, tent stakes/rebar is the only MOOP Category that can cause harm and injury, especially for vehicles driving on the playa. As a citizen of Black Rock City, you and you alone are responsible for your impact on the playa. You must account for all of your tent stakes/rebar and pull them out of the ground. Under no circumstances are you supposed to hammer them deeper into the ground because that will only postpone the inevitable when they surface. There are many methods to pull stakes out of the ground. Our favorite is using a simple pair of vise-grips and twisting until the stakes essentially unscrew and pull out. If you are having difficulty, ask for help. If you absolutely can’t and there is no one around, then the last resort is to mark them obviously to warn others and signal for attention.\n\nNew MOOP Category: Micro-MOOP (n) — a miscellaneous classification of MOOP debris, described as shredded, broken, extremely small (under .5cm) and difficult to identify, especially in playa dust. Examples: glitter, broken glass, fabric bits, drilled plastic, hair, artificial grass fibers, wood debris, paint chips or any combination thereof. Sentence — “The little artificial grass fibers stuck to the ground and created a lot of micro-MOOP that needed to be shoveled up.”\n\nTOP MOOP 2019\n\nWhile Playa Restoration’s primary responsibility is to clean up the 156 million square feet of Black Rock City in time for the BLM Inspection, we also capture as much MOOP information as possible for educational purposes.\n\nHere, we’ve broken down MOOP into its core classifications and ranked them in order of occurrences.\n\nAbout the Inspection\n\nThe BLM’s Post-Event Site Inspection took place on Saturday, October 5, 2019. We were present at the BLM’s MOOP analysis where 125 out of 126 test areas passed the 1sq.ft./acre debris standard with flying colors while only one small test area exceeded the allowable limit by a mere two inches!\n\nIt is paramount that we continue to uphold this standard and leave the lands clean, beautiful, and without a trace to ensure the environmental sustainability of the event, and to be good members of the Northern Nevada community.\n\nThank You\n\nFrom the bottom of my burning heart, thank you to everyone on the Playa Restoration All-Star Team for all of your tireless efforts and dedication toward Leaving No Trace on the Black Rock Desert and for achieving an unprecedented near-perfect score victory during an unbelievably tumultuous year. I could not dream of a better outcome to celebrate my 20th year on Resto and 15th as manager, and I could not be prouder.\n\nOur work may not always be seen or understood, but know that the world will catch on in time. You are today’s and tomorrow’s leaders and the planet’s future is brighter with you in it. On behalf of the playa, Restoration, and the Department of Public Works, thank you for being here and for Leaving No Trace.\n\nAnd thank you, everyone in the worldwide Burning Man/Black Rock City community, for your practice and support of the Leaving No Trace Principle.\n\nWe may not always be perfect, but it is always a practice. And practice makes… well, you know. It is only together that we achieved this unprecedented victory. Leaving No Trace is just the beginning. Where we go from here is up to you. To be continued.\n\nThe Great Disappearing City from Profiles in Dust",
