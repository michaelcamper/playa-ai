Learn more and register here.\n\nBurning Man 2025 is ready for launch! Galvanized by the theme Tomorrow Today, Black Rock City 2025 is awakening in thousands of hearts, minds and imaginations. With great anticipation, here is everything you need to know about tickets to Black Rock City 2025.\n\nWhat’s new? With Radical Inclusion and Gifting guiding this year’s ticket offerings, momentum is building for the best Burning Man ever. Tickets to Black Rock City 2025 start at $550 and range up to $3,000 on a tiered and flexible model. With ticket prices lowered to $550 this year, we’re keeping Burning Man financially accessible and culturally diverse — welcoming all to build, explore, dance and connect. This lower price is supported by several tiers of higher-priced tickets. When you buy a ticket priced $750 or higher, you cover the full cost per participant to produce Black Rock City, which was an estimated $749 in 2023. This means YOU are helping to bring more dusty humans, and sponsoring more participatory art, Radical Self-expression, joy and awe in the wondrous city we all build together.\n\nThis is part of a larger shift to make it easier for more amazing and creative beings to participate in Black Rock City 2025. The barriers are coming down. The gates are opening wider. YOU and your friends are cordially invited to participate in co-creating one of the planet’s most phantasmagorical experiences.\n\nThe best opportunity to secure lower price tickets to Black Rock City is the ‘Today Sale’.\n\nRegister for the ‘Today Sale’ Monday, February 3rd at 12pm PST for 8 days through Tuesday, February 11, at 12pm PST. The ‘Today Sale’ starts on Wednesday, February 12, 2025 at 12pm PST.\n\nWhy put off until Tomorrow what you can do Today? Secure your ticket early and jumpstart Black Rock City’s powerful engine.\n\nImportant Dates for the ‘Today’ Black Rock City 2025 Ticket Sale\n\nRegister, access ticket sales, and find all information at tickets.burningman.org.\n\nNEW AND IMPORTANT DETAILS ABOUT BLACK ROCK CITY 2025 TICKET SALES\n\nTHE THREE PUBLIC BLACK ROCK CITY 2025 TICKET SALE DATES ARE:\n\nBLACK ROCK CITY 2025 TICKET PRICES\n\nThe cost to produce Black Rock City in 2023 was an estimated $749 per participant. This means that when you purchase a ticket to Black Rock City 2025 for $750 or more, YOUR generosity helps more people experience the magic of Burning Man, funds Honoraria art grants, and underwrites Black Rock City operational costs.\n\nYOU decide how much you want to pay. Subject to availability, ticket prices begin at $550. Prices scale up from here — $650, $750 and $950. There are also $1,500 and $3,000 tickets, which support more Burning Man for more people by subsidizing reduced-price tickets through programs such as Ticket Aid and Resilience.\n\nLearn all about 2025 ticket pricing on the ticketing page.\n\nThe Ticket Aid program will once again make reduced-price tickets available to people with limited financial means. The application opens on February 19.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS NEW WITH 2025 TICKETS?\n\nAs mentioned above, You will not need to create a Burner Profile for public ticket sales. But you will need to register for each sale individually; the link to register can be found on the ticket page during registration periods.\n\nStewards Sale Tickets for Camp, Art and Mutant Vehicle Crews\nAs usual the Stewards sale has its own ticket allotments reserved and unrelated to the ‘Today Sale’. New for 2025: Camp and crew leads can opt to allocate tickets as they always have, OR they can opt to make one purchase to buy the group of tickets for their crew. This option must be arranged in advance of the start of the Stewards Sale. Allocating tickets for the Stewards Sale will still require a Burner Profile. Stewards Sale allocations will be open February 21-28; the sale will happen in early March 2025.\n\nIntroducing the Renaissance Champions and Resilience Ticket Programs\nTwo new programs are opening their doors to support community members and invite participation in Black Rock City. More information about both of these programs will be announced by February 19.\n\nThere will be NO FOMO sale for 2025, and maybe never again. If you’d like to create more Radical Inclusion by making a gift of $2,500 (the former FOMO price) that supports participant access and art Honoraria grants, read about a limited time opportunity to do so through the Patron of Black Rock City Program.\n\nOK. ARE YOU READY FOR THE BEST BURNING MAN EVER?\n\nAs the Burning Man joke goes: It was better next year. After a phantasmagorical 2024 event, with stellar weather, an amazing vibe playa-wide, and so much mind-bending art and music… How can YOU, and collectively WE, make Burning Man even BETTER this year? As we roll into “Tomorrow Today” together, we are all being called to reimagine what Burning Man can become, how it can catalyze the most playful, innovative, creative aspects of humanity.\n\nWhat are you imagining? Now’s the time to commit. Get your ticket and start planning, organizing, building and bringing it into the world. Get started here.\n\n#bestburningmanever #thankslarry #tomorrowtoday #BurningMan2025",
