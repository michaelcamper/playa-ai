  "content": "So, what if you had a soulmate, but your love only lived for one week a year in a mostly uninhabitable desert? And what if your soulmate wasn’t only your cosmic match, but some kind of mirror version of you? And on top of all that, what if you were married…to other people?\n\nEpisode 2 of Burning Love — the podcast about falling in love in the dust and trying to bring it home — has all of that and then some.\n\nPresenting, Twin Flames, a story of tragic love, paranormal activity, psychic communication, and river rafting in two parts. If Nicholas Sparks went to Burning Man, he’d write this story.\n\nAlso featuring original art made from photos of the couple by Guardian / Melissa Cetlin.\n\nMore episodes of Burning Love are in progress. There’s also an open call for a special but all too common playa love story: One that soared and then…crashed.\n\nDid you fall madly in love with someone in the desert, sure on Day 2 they were The One? Did you return home and leave a marriage, move cross country, or take some other kind of radical leap of faith, and only to discover the person you knew was your perfect match…wasn’t?\n\nDrop a line to burninglovetheshow@gmail.com. Plot twists, hijinks, and high drama welcome.\n\nRead about the launch of Burning Love and the happily ever after Episode 1, Until the End of the Playa, in this BMJ post. Subscribe to the show on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play Music, or, as they like to say say, wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nHappy listening.\n\nDetails have been changed to protect anonymity.",
