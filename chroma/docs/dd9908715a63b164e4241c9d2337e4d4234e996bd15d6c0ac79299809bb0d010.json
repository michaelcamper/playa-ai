  "content": "Someone ran into the fire at this year’s Burn. That affects everything…and nothing. As soon as I got off Playa people began messaging me with, “I heard someone died!” In this video I try to explain my feelings and reactions.\n\n*I am not an official representative of Burning Man. Just a 20 year Participant who believes in this community with all his heart. You can see lots more of my thoughts about Burning Man in this Journal or YouTube.",
