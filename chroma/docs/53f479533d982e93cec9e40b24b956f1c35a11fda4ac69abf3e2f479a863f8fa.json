You take a moment to wonder why you signed up for a morning shift that starts at 6 am. Then you remember that you enjoy giving back to BRC, and sometimes that involves getting up early to go on shift. [Ranger shifts run 24/7, so there are shifts for early-birds and night-owls both.]\n\nYou change into your Ranger “costume” — recognizably khaki-colored with the distinctive Ranger logo. You get jazzed that you finally added all the patches you collected from the last three years.\n\nYou hop on your bike and pedal to Ranger HQ, just next to Center Camp. You sign in for your shift, and check out a radio from the friendly Rangers working the HQ window.  You watch the sun rise as your shift begins — another beautiful day in BRC!\n\nYou get “cruise directed” by a Shift Lead who gives you a portion of the city to patrol with your Ranger partner.\n\nYou’ve been assigned a quadrant of the inner playa — cool! You get to check out some art!\n\nOn your way to your patrol area, you and your partner stop by Center Camp for some coffee.\n\nWhile you’re there, you direct a trio of people who just arrived in BRC to the nearest porta-potties.\n\nNow that you’re caffeinated, you and your partner slowly cruise your section of the playa on your bikes, looking at the art and saying “hello” to the few folks you meet at that hour.\n\nA couple of hours into your shift, you watch someone tumble from their bike from about 200 yards away. It looks like a bad one, so you and your partner head over to make sure the participant is okay.\n\nTurns out that she’s pretty banged up and hit her head, so you grab your radio and call for a medical response. You sit and chat with the participant and her friends while you wait for the team from Rampart to arrive. They take over, and get her loaded into their golf cart. You go back to your slow tour of the inner playa art.\n\nOne of the art pieces you discover is a beautifully shaded installation with some comfy-looking places to sit. After consulting with your partner, you decide that you need to “ranger” this shade, and you sit and take a load off for awhile.\n\nAround 10 am, a shift lead calls you on the radio and asks how you’re doing. You respond that you could use a change of scenery. After managing your liquids at HQ, you and your partner are off to your new patrol area in the back streets of the city behind Center Camp.\n\nOne of the camps you encounter along K street is gifting screenprints on clothing, so you happily strip off your Ranger t-shirt and ask them to decorate it. While you watch the pros at work, they ask you questions about Rangering: “No, we’re not cops. We’re participants just like you.”\n\nAs the clock reaches 12 noon, your shift lead calls you back in and thanks you for your service to the city. You go back to Ranger HQ, return your radio, and check out from shift. You decide to head back to camp for some food and a nap, leaving the city in the capable hands of the afternoon shift.\n\nHow do I Become a Ranger?\n\nThink Rangering might be for you? Are you the person your camp-mates turn to when they want someone to solve problems and mediate tension or unhappiness? Want to expand your mediation and problem-solving skills as a leader in the community?\n\nProspective Rangers are at least 18 years or older. You must have been to Burning Man at least twice, and at least once in the past 10 years.\n\nPotential Rangers have the following traits:\n\nFind out more about the Ranger application process.\n\n(Top by photo by Bill Kositzky)",
