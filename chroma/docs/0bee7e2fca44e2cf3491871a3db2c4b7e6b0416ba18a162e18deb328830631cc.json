Here the leaders of the great religions have sought the therapeutic and spiritual values of retreat, not to escape but to find reality.”\n— Paul Shepard\n\n1.\nEven the dead become art—\nnothing here needs burial, not\nthe bone tree, nor metal magnolias\nblooming. Not the skin of dust.\n\nIt’s the earth that’s a shadow.\nA pint is a pound, the world\nround defies meaning here—\nWe slant into a waterless horizon.\n\nAnd the horses say, cloppity clop.\nThe moon, a gnome’s ass.\nNothing is as it seems.\nEverything is as it seems.\n\n2.\nThe question mark\nof a collar bone,\nthe flash under skin,\nthin and tight like a tent.\n\nDust soaks our eyes.\nWithout the usual\nborders, gravity\nhas pulled from us\neven our names.\n\n3.\nDrift on a lifeboat,\na submarine, a magic carpet.\nThe sun rises, red and ripe\n\nlike a plum. We sit together,\npass the blue bottle. The beat\nof a distant drum echoes\n\nacross the ancient lake bed,\nthe pink glow burns mirthless\nin our eyes. How I’ve grown\nafraid of myself.\n\n4.\nTemples are always\nconstructed from wood\n\nand from pain. Words\nturn to fire, then ash\n\nand smoke. Again,\ndawn evaporates the stars.\n\n5.\nThe scorched sea stretches\ninto the perpetual near-dawn sky.\n\nHere are the rules: The world\neventually folds in on itself,\n\nlike any other world,\nand disappears. No matter,\n\nthe dust still clings to our hair.\n\nby Suzanne Roberts",
