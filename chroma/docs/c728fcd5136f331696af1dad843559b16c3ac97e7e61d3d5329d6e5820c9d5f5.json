  "content": "It’s time to really kick off the 2017 Burning Man season. Behold! Here are this year’s art installations selected for Black Rock City Honoraria Grants.\n\nApplicants really embraced this year’s Radical Ritual theme. We’ll find many opportunities for ceremony and ritual, honoring and elevating in shrines, altars, temples, icons, cathedrals — even tombs. Of course, this being Burning Man, it’s a playful mix of the sacred and the profane.\n\nOther projects will emphasize the more magical end of the spectrum. Kevin Clark’s 70-foot Flower Tower could be considered a cathedral, sure — except it’s covered in thousands of painted metal flowers that breathe flames. There’s a Field of Fairies by Bill Neely, and a field of fairy shrimp called Of a Temporary Nature. A 12-year-old from Massachusetts is building Flora Resplendica, a giant teapot bedecked with mushrooms and flowers.\n\nOther pieces will incorporate movement and pageantry, as befits any ritual celebration. You’ll want to keep an eye out for Step Forward, a 20-foot articulated puppet girl from the street theater tradition of Spain named Euterpe who walks and converses. It’s her first time in BRC, and every day she learns, acculturates and transforms via interactions with participants. And hailing from France will be the Color Wheels, a spectacular parade of a dozen metallic wheels each day at sunset.\n\nStill more will consider the natural world around us. Animals are always a popular theme, but check out how many species will be represented this year: mother bear and her cubs, jellyfish, dung beetle, dragonflies, fairy shrimp, huge owl, cosmic space worm, birds, fish, giant pink flamingo, a flaming steel rooster teeter totter, kinetic Australian insect, ravens, and gummy bears (if those count as animals).\n\nAnd these are just a few of the pieces that can be easily crammed into categories. There’s so much more where that came from!\n\nThe Temple\n\nThe 18th incarnation of the Temple — sticking with the plain and simple name, The Temple — will be designed by Steven Brummond, Marisha Farnsworth and Mark Sinclair. They were leads on David Best’s temples; two are architects and one is a structural engineer. It will be an impressive 80 feet tall and 120 feet across. They’re milling the lumber themselves, and most of the build will be at a sawmill in Sonora, CA. From their description:\n\nReturning Favorites\n\nMany of your favorite BRC artists are coming back for more, including Flaming Lotus Girls, Iron Monkeys, Dana Albany, Dadara, Charlie Smith, Mr and Mrs Ferguson with the evolution of their pennies sculptures (Ursa Mater), Peter Hudson returning with his zoetrope Charon (last seen in 2011), Temple of Gravity by Zach Coffin will return for the first time since 2003, and last year’s smash hit La Victrola is coming back for an encore with its giant Art Nouveau gramophone spruced up for 2017.\n\nThe Illustrious Grantees\n\nBurning Man Arts is funding BRC art to the tune of $1.2 million this year, including these Honoraria recipients, as well as the Shrines and Processionals in the city plazas and around the Man.\n\nEighteen international projects received Honoraria grants (up from seven last year): two in the United Kingdom, two in Australia and one each in Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, México, Netherlands, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and Spain. Six Honoraria recipients have never been to Black Rock City, and 12 more are bringing an art installation for the first time. And no report on Burning Man art would be complete without mentioning that, of the 75 projects granted BRC Honoraria, 23 of them will play with fire.\n\nOf course, most of the 300+ art installations in BRC are stuff people just do on their own, with or without outside funding. So peruse the 2017 BRC Honoraria projects, and if you have some vision that is missing from the list, you are warmly invited to make it happen.\n\nFull project descriptions with images and links will be available later in the season.\n\n2017 Black Rock City Honoraria Recipients\n\nAction Figure Family — Jeff Allen Ricks — Palm Springs, CA\n\nAltar de Reflexion — Andria Dawn — Mariposa, CA\n\nAluna — Juan David Marulanda & Team Aluna — Bogotá, Colombia\n\nAqueous — Jen Lewin — New York, NY\n\nBlacksmith Shop — Anton Standteiner & Blacksmith Shop — Truckee, CA\n\nBloom — Peter Hazel — Reno, NV\n\nBRC Historic Landmark Plaques — Heyu Kelley & Ski Patrol — Chicago, IL\n\nCelestial Field — Eleanor Cranke — London, United Kingdom\n\nCharon — Peter Hudson — San Francisco, CA\n\nCosmic Space Worm — Tyler FuQua — Eagle Creek, OR\n\nDance For The Dawn — Karolis Misevicius & Lithuania Burners — Vilnius, Lithuania\n\nDaruma — Angela Chang & The Daruma Project — Los Angeles, CA\n\nDesert Eyes — Pooya Kamranjam — Detmold, Germany\n\nEfflorescence — Stacey Scriven & the Blazin’ Lily Gals — Calgary, Canada\n\nField of Fairies — Bill Neely & NF/Observatory LTD — Silver City, NM\n\nFire Ancestor — Trey Watkins & Frogma — San Francisco, CA\n\nFire Spinner — Anton Viditz-Ward & Deep Creek Experimental — Telluride, CO\n\nFlight of Illumination — Iron Monkey Arts — Seattle, WA\n\nFlora Resplendica — Mayahuel Morse — Malden, MA\n\nGummie Bear Mandala Pyramid — Karla DelCarpio — Long Beach, CA\n\nHeardt — Tomáš Bukáček & Blok_4 — Úhonice, Czech Republic\n\nHispatext — Mariano Rodriguez Ribas & Gauchos del Fuego — Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nHouse of doG — Daniel Garcia — Denver, CO\n\nHouse of Enlightenment — Douglas Ruuska & Divide by Zero Labs — Brighton, MA\n\nHurry up Slowly — Freetown Christiania — Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nIN CASE: A UKE — Justin Lange — Brooklyn, NY\n\nIncinerator for Obsolete Resentments — Anton Viditz-Ward, Duncan, Claude, Gary, Pepper, Adrienne, Jake, Dan & Deep Creek Experimental — Telluride, CO\n\nInterspecies Communication — Ela Lamblin & Lelavision — Vashon, WA\n\nLa Victrola — La Victrola Society — Oakland, CA\n\nLight Years Away — Wynn Buzzell — Denver, CO\n\nMacchina Naturale — David Boyer — Reno, NV\n\nMagnetic Waltz — Frankie Meyers & The Phage/The Institute — Richmond, CA\n\nMargareta Appalachia — James Michael Eros — Houston, TX\n\nMethuselah V.2 — Misha Naiman, Gray Davidson & Majorelle Arts — Oakland, CA\n\nMúcaro — el NiNO Alicea — Puerto Rico\n\nNOETICA — Flaming Lotus Girls — San Francisco, CA\n\nOf a Temporary Nature — P.
