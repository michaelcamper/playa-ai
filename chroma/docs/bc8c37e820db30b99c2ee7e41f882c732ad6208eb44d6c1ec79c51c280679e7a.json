  "content": "This is a video reply to an email question I was sent:\n\nThe gist of my response:\n\nI feel this too!\nI try to remind myself: Everyone here is here to share their gifts. Receiving those gifts completes the equation.\nAppreciating art, enjoying a shade structure, sampling a morsel, noticing an outfit, complementing a camp vibe. This is all part of a Gift Economy!\n\nPink Heart (my camp) spends so much time furring couches, building structures, figuring out logistics. When we see people enjoy our gift, it lights us up! Your Joy gives me Joy.\n\nThe same is true when people appreciate my outfits, a talk I share, the ice cream we serve or the vibe of our camp.\nI LIVE to share these gifts. Literally.\n\nYou receiving it lights me up. Without you, I am nothing. (That was the the title of a Burning Man doc a few years back.)\nFor a chef, the gift of a meal would feel empty if nobody ate it. The chef’s joy comes when his meal is appreciated.\n\nYou mentioned being a bother. And quite honestly, there may be times when time is tight, a conversation is deep, or a crisis is going on. There are so many distractions, but a patient, polite person is a WELCOME distraction!\n\nYou don’t NEED an excuse to interact, but if it makes you more comfortable, ask:\n\nIn the default world – if you walk up to my front porch, into my office, or approach me on the street;\nI assume you want money, a signature, or in my pants. That is the consequence of a transactional world.\nEveryone has an angle. What do you want out of this interaction?\n\nBut the magic of Black Rock City is that we remove that dynamic. And so we allow a new reason to interact: To share, to compliment, to appreciate, to get to know!\n\nIt is totally acceptable to say, “You look like a fascinating person. I would love to know a little more about you.”\nOf course, this only works if you mean it.\n(If you only say that to attractive, half naked young boys or girls, then may have slipped back into a creepy, transactional way of thinking.)\n\nIf someone is in a “I’m just here to hangout with my friends” vibe, THEY are the ones out of place. They can do that in the private area of a camp.\n\nBeing shy is forgetting about the supportive participatory BRC social dynamic and falling into the judgmental default world dynamic.\n\nThe antidote to shyness in Black Rock City and everywhere is the same: Switch to a gifting mentality.\n\nI want to learn who this person is.\nI want to share who I am.\n\nYou – the real you – is a gift. Just like every miracle of this Universe.\n\nYour gifts and your participation are what makes the magic work.\n\nI hope I get to experience YOU.\n\nLove,\nHalcyon",
