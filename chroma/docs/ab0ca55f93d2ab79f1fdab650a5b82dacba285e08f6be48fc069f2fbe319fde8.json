  "content": "In some ways we’re all experiencing the great FOMO: missing out on all the things we love, to stay in with our loved ones — and flatten that damn curve. In other ways, it’s the best time ever to join all the parties, workshops and events you’ve ever dreamed of, all over the world — without leaving the house.\n\nWant to find out what’s going on Saturday night in Berlin? There’s a virtual nightclub for that. Want to feel welcome in a random self-help group with people you’ve never met before?  Come along for the ride! We’re all diving in and out of the shelter-in-place multiverse together, meeting new humans and learning new things.\n\nHere are some of the Burner-run and Burner-adjacent virtual events you can explore in the next six days, including TWO virtual Regional Burns this weekend! Are you hosting a virtual event in the coming weeks? Tell us about it here.\n\nWhen and How Much? Some Pointers\n\nMost of the events are free, but some ask for a donation towards costs or are raising funds for vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. For those who are timezone-challenged, you can wrap your head around who’s coming to you from the past or future here.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDaily Events\n\nHug Nation Twice Daily Gatherings\n\nTimes: 12pm & 6pm (PT)\nGather for a moment of connection twice daily.
