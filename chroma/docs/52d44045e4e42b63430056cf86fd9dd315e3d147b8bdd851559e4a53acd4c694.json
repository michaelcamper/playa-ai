  "content": "You may have heard about our fundraising efforts and that we need ongoing charitable support to keep making Burning Man happen, in the Black Rock Desert and all over the world.\n\nThese FAQs provide info about Burning Man Project’s mission, programs, and funding. Stick with us as together we work to secure Burning Man as a cultural institution that will be here decades from now, empowering future generations to reimagine the world they live in.\n\nNONPROFIT\n\nWhy is it important for Burning Man Project to facilitate programs beyond Black Rock City?\n\nFor the nonprofit to fulfill its mission “to facilitate and extend the culture that has issued from the Burning Man event into the larger world,” it means making Burning Man culture accessible through diversified, impactful programming.\n\nPeople naturally come to us with ideas for how they can create participatory events and experiences, support community resilience, or carry out disaster relief work. We give them tools and knowledge to create projects and events that are decommodified, participatory and inspired by our culture.\n\nBurning Man is not, nor has it ever been, “just a festival.” Black Rock City serves as the heart and foundation of our global community and will always remain our priority. But, to focus solely on producing the event would be doing a disservice to all the amazing people and projects that are actively bringing the Burning Man ethos to the world.\n\nWhat role do Northern Nevada properties, including Fly Ranch, and programs like the Regionals and Burners Without Borders (BWB) play in advancing Burning Man’s mission?\n\nBurning Man’s Northern Nevada properties provide the platform for prototyping the community and regenerative practices of the future.\n\nCampouts at Fly Ranch, for example, have produced and fueled participant efforts around sustainability, including: Burner Leadership Achieving Sustainable Theme Camps (BLAST), Renewables for Artists Team (RAT), and the Green Theme Camp Community. All of these groups bring their forward-thinking solutions to life in Black Rock City and iterate towards solutions for the world. Additionally, the nature walks at Fly Ranch are open to the public.\n\nOther properties are used to store Black Rock City infrastructure, which saves on trucking from Reno and allows us to maintain extensive assets used to deploy BRC. Our year round presence in Gerlach supports the event and culture.\n\nFor nearly 20 years, local Burners Without Borders (BWB) groups have utilized the skills and can-do attitude embodied by so many in Black Rock City to respond with kindness, connection and humanitarian and community support — from Hurricane Katrina (the beginning of BWB) to Hurricane Helene and everything in between.\n\nAnd, as we wrote about recently in Sparking Kindness & Connection, From the Windy City to Rural Romania, Black Rock City participants were inspired to create RoBurn, an official Burning Man Regional Event in Romania. Romanian members of our community use their Regional to reach out to isolated elders. Through the Regional Network, we provide tools and share best practices that enable anyone, anywhere (including the RoBurn founders), to manifest Burning Man’s 10 Principles for the benefit of their local community.\n\nThe connection, creativity and innovation resulting from these programs and properties facilitates and extends Burning Man culture in the wider world.\n\nFINANCES\n\nWhy is this year’s fundraising goal $20 million?\n\nSince becoming a nonprofit, we have raised funds to support operations. At the start of 2024, our philanthropic fundraising goal for the year was $10M. The $5.7M revenue shortfall resulting from 2024 Black Rock City higher-priced tickets not selling as planned, combined with a $3M dip in main sale tickets and vehicle passes means our initial year-end charitable donation target essentially doubled to nearly $20M.\n\nThe main sale ticket price is not priced to cover event costs (more on that below) and higher-priced ticket tiers have subsidized the event as a form of philanthropy for years. This is why recurring philanthropic support is needed to sustain our mission – now and into the future. See our Summary Financial Information for the details.\n\nFor us to continue enabling togetherness, mental well-being, creativity, innovation, and storytelling that sparks change, we must rise to this challenge. Philanthropy will help us maintain Black Rock City as the vibrant heart of Burning Man, and protect the culture with which the event is intertwined.\n\nWhat do donations fund?\n\nDonations fuel everything which is core to Burning Man!\n\nWhy don’t ticket sales cover the cost to produce Black Rock City?\n\nWhile at face value it might sound crazy, we have purposefully maintained lower ticket prices–lower than the cost to produce Black Rock City. In 2023, for example, the cost to produce Black Rock City was an estimated $749 per participant while the main sale ticket price was $575. This intentional price-setting aims to keep Black Rock City accessible.\n\nWe aren’t like traditional festivals. Whereas traditional festivals subsidize their ticket costs through corporate sponsorship, VIP benefits, and other commercial mechanisms, (which can account for between 25-30% of revenue), we rely on philanthropy to cover the difference.\n\nBlack Rock City is free from brand influence and transactions which enables more authentic engagement, contributing to and shaping the experience of the ephemeral city.\n\nThrough 2023 we have fortunately been able to maintain lower ticket prices because of the generosity of our community, including through sales of higher-priced tickets (a concept we first talked about back in 2016).\n\nNow and into the future, the community’s generosity and broad philanthropic support is needed to keep ticket prices reasonable and Black Rock City culturally diverse. This is the model by which nonprofit theaters, museums, opera and ballet companies survive. Same goes for universities who count on supportive alumni. In all cases, the cost of admission, tuition, or a ticket to the event doesn’t cover all of what the cultural experience is offering. These cultural institutions, like us, rely on community support from people who believe in their mission.\n\nHow is the estimated $749 per participant cost to Black Rock City 2023 calculated?\n\nFeel free to check out our Summary Financial Information for cost per participant dating back the past 10 years. Specific to 2023, the cost per participant was an estimated $749. This includes the cost of Black Rock City and the Arts program, as well as 80% of the time in Management and Administration, divided by the population as indicated on the Burning Man timeline website and submitted and agreed upon with the Bureau of Land Management. Management and Administration is primarily composed of Information Technology, Accounting, and People Operations, where the efforts are approximately 80% of the time focused on supporting Black Rock City.\n\nWould an increase in ticket prices help?\n\nRaising ticket prices would increase ticket revenue, however, Burning Man is different and always has been. Increasing ticket prices would call our Principle of Radical Inclusion into question. We have cultural diversity, with participants representing all 50 of the United States. In 2024, we had 89 countries represented. Philanthropy, which is key to subsidizing ticket prices, helps us avoid a situation where the cost of a ticket prevents a community member or new Burner from coming to Black Rock City.\n\nCould Regional Events drive revenue?\n\nNo, Regional Events are not a money-maker. Burning Man Project offers guidance to Regional Events, but we don’t fund them or earn revenue from them (hat tip to Regional Events that have made donations to Burning Man Project!). These gatherings are locally organized and are financially separate from Burning Man Project. Providing counsel and liaising with Regionals is an incredibly effective way to advance our mission and support the growth of Burning Man culture.\n\nWhat about the office space? Could greater savings be achieved, particularly in San Francisco?\n\nMaintaining our office space, the footprint of which we reduced by half in San Francisco during the pandemic, is vitally important. Building connections in person is core to Burning Man culture, and to our ability to work efficiently, collaborate deeply and innovate for the future. In working to reduce costs expected in 2025 (and beyond), we were pleased to work with our landlords in Reno and San Francisco to find savings in rent.\n\nSpecific to San Francisco, Burning Man was born here, and it is home to the largest number of Burning Man creators and participants. The majority of our year-round staff and volunteers also live in the Bay Area. It is a venue for fundraising, a gathering space for up to 120 people, and a space to host donors, for staff and board meetings.\n\nAre Burning Man Project board members compensated?\n\nUnlike for-profit boards, we have no Burning Man Project board member compensated in their capacity as a board member. However, we do have board members employed in staff roles, including five of the six Burning Man Cultural Founders who have built the event since before 1997 and designed the mission for the Burning Man Project since 2008. Will Roger Peterson is employed as Director of Nevada Relations; Crimson Rose (listed in the 990s as Nanci Peterson) is Art Transitional Officer (she also holds the official title of Secretary of the Board, which means she is responsible for official filings and approval of meeting minutes); Michael Mikel is Historian & Archivist; Harley K. Dubois is Chief Culture Officer and Marian Goodell is Chief Executive Officer. These five founders are also Board Directors and join the other 13 Directors serving on the board. The 990 lists other key employees or highly compensated individuals with the title of “Director of…..or ….. Director”, like Charlie Dolman who is Director of Event Operations. These are not “Board Directors.”\n\nWhat is Burning Man Project doing to reduce costs?\n\nIn examining and restructuring our operations, we’ve reduced our expected 2025 (and beyond) costs by several millions of dollars. Our efforts have already included reductions in vendor and payroll costs, including reductions in the number of regular year-round employees on staff, and office rent reductions.\n\nWe continue to trim an already lean and tight Black Rock City infrastructure and nonprofit management. However, we can’t budget-cut our way to securing the long term future of Burning Man. It’s taken nearly 40 years to build the Burning Man culture and Black Rock City event to where it is now. Bringing joy, collaboration, art, and innovation through our culture co-created with amazing people all over the world is the priority and will remain so as we balance it with good business practices.\n\nFor Burning Man to continue on into the future — not just as an annual event in the desert, but as a cultural institution that will be here decades from now, empowering future generations to reimagine the world they live in – community support through philanthropy is imperative.\n\nWhat is Burning Man Project’s long-term financial strategy?\n\nLong-term financial planning is essential to sustain our mission to bring more Burning Man to the world, including through Black Rock City. Our long-term plan aims to reduce reliance on ticket sales by emphasizing diversified revenue sources and expansion of philanthropy and grants. Further, building a significant reserve and, in the long-term also an endowment, are things that will enable stability and continuity in the face of economic shifts. The reserve and deeper philanthropy will enable us to support a culturally diverse Black Rock City and keep the event decommodified.\n\nAre major donors granted special decision-making power?\n\nNo—donors are not granted special decision-making power. You can read more about it here, our statement of values on gifting.\n\nWhy should I donate when I already volunteer and contribute significantly to my Burning Man camp or project?\n\nFirst, thank you for every moment you’ve dedicated to making Burning Man what it is today. We appreciate how much you give and can’t overstate our gratitude. <3\n\nGifting is part of the culture and comes in many forms. We can’t all do everything. We all lean into what we co-create in different ways.\n\nDonations power everything we do to get more Burning Man in the world, and there are many reasons to make a gift today. Like an alumni organization, we see anyone that’s ever attended Burning Man as part of the culture. We want to give everyone a chance to help support us whether they attend Black Rock City currently or not.\n\nIf you can’t donate, you can help by spreading the word about why Burning Man matters. It may inspire others to give. This outreach, along with your continued participation – as a theme camp lead, an artist, a mutant vehicle visionary, a performer, a costumer, a musician, a chef, a sous chef, a Black Rock City volunteer, a mechanic, and electrician, a programmer, a staff member, a regional contact, a filmmaker, a photographer, a writer, a storyteller, or however you like to be involved – helps ensure the spirit of the playa continues to thrive and impact the world for the better.\n\nWe so ardently believe the world can benefit from the magic, creativity, and inspiration of Burning Man. And that’s why we’re letting our entire community know – why we’re letting you know – that we need philanthropic support to continue our mission.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nEarlier communications on the blog:\n\nRecent email storytelling:\n\nSummary Financial Information",
