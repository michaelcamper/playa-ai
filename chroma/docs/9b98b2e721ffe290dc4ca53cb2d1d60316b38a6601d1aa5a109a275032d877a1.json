  "content": "There was a lie that spread through our community this year like a virus.\nThis mistruth was far more insidious than any fake trash fence concert, under-Playa tunnel system or elusive “dark rave.”\nIt continues to affect the way we interact with one another. (You may even still believe the information to be true.)\n\nBut I am here to set the record straight:\nThere is nothing wrong with a traditional hug.\nBy “traditional” I mean that you lean to the left as you embrace.\n\n\nThis year I was ”corrected” close to 100 times by people who explained that the right way to hug was “heart-to-heart.”\nThis was usually followed by some version of a story about how the traditional hug aligns our livers and therefore creates a toxic exchange of energy. Whereas the heart-to-heart aligns our hearts and therefore results in a more loving exchange.\n\nNow, let me be clear: I think a heart-to-heart hug is great. And if you want to suggest we do a right-leaning hug after we do our traditional hug, that sounds super to me. The more hugs the better.\nBut what often happens is that people stop me mid hug and “correct” me during the approach.\n“No…let’s do it heart to heart!”\n\nYou may have even done this yourself. I get it, you meant well. Who wants to spread toxic liver vibes?! But what ends up happening is that the loving process of a hug abruptly becomes “wrong.”\n1) I see someone I care about.\n2) Our eyes light up.\n3) We approach one another, arms outstretched.\n4) Then as I am beginning to surrender into their warm embrace I hear, “Wait, no…” I am chastised and corrected. NO! BAD! BAD BOY!\n\nThis is the exact opposite intention of a hug.\n\nNow, to address the root of this virus:\nThere is nothing toxic about a traditional hug.\n\nA traditional hug is AWESOME.\nA hug is the most basic expression of connection that exists between two humans. If you prefer them right-leaning, fine. But a full body embrace is a beautiful thing that has nothing to do with the alignment of organs. (A sexual embrace is much more organ-dependant…but that is an entirely different topic.)\nI’m not sure who started this idea virus about toxic hugs. I’m sure it was someone well-meaning, heart-centered, chakra-balanced, and micro-biotic. Or maybe it was a whiskey-swilling trickster.\n\nBut I am here to set the record straight.: All hugs are good.\nSeriously. Let’s think about this.\nHow many of your (left-leaning) mom hugs while growing up filled you with profound comfort and safety?\nHow many of your past lovers’ (left-leaning) sunset embraces left you buzzing?\nHow many (left-leaning) hugs have you given your children that washed away their tears?\n\nI don’t mean to pull rank here, but I have hosted the weekly podcast, “Hug Nation” for 13 years. Online friends send me every article on hugging that gets published. People are eager to share every new hug technique they learn with me. (Cinnamon Swirl, anyone?)\n\nI have literally hugged 10’s of thousands of strangers – nearly all by learning left. And the connection has always been pure, beautiful, and love-filled.\nHeck, we may have even hugged at a festival in the past. If not, hopefully it is just a matter of time. If you are unconvinced by my ranting here, we can plan on doing both a traditional and a heart-to-heart when we meet.\n\nIn some circles of friends, the heart-to-heart has become the norm. I have no issue with that (although I have had my share of “head bonk” near misses). Some people have even perfected a hugging approach that severely exaggerates the right lean to ensure they get a heart-to-heart. That is a fine solution if you can do it without making the recipient feel awkward. What I feel called to address is the demonizing of the traditional hug and the act of correcting people as they enter an embrace. There are so many things that need fixing in this world – the hug is not one of them.\nSo, while I am thrilled to see people excited about any type of hugging, I ask that a heart-to-heart is done *in addition* to the perfect traditional hug that we have all grown up with.\nAnd while I do consider myself a hugging expert, I admit that there are those who know far more about hugging than I. So I humbly bow to the wisdom of Amma, the greatest hugger on the planet – perhaps ever to inhabit a human body. She has hugged over 33 million people. I once waited in line for a full day to receive one of here profoundly love-filled hugs. Guess how this living saint hugged me? Yup. Liver-to-liver.\n\nBut this isn’t just about hugs.\n\nIt is about how easily we believe what we’re told – and how quick we are to pass it on.\n\nRemember: Experience is truth. Everything else is stories.\n\nWe must be in a constant state of evaluating the stories we are told. Believe whatever you want, but do so by choice. Do so with awareness. Do so with a degree of inquiry.\nRonald Reagan once said, “Trust, but verify.” And in this area, I agree with him.\nCaution is becoming exponentially important as faux-news sites are being blindly shared in social media among our community.\n\nSkrillex and Diplo did not get booed.\nPlug-And-Play camps did not ruin Burning Man.\nThere is nothing wrong with a hug.\n\nLove,\n-Halcyon",
