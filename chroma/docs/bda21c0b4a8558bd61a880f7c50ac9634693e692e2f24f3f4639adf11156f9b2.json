  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is still back with a third season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for experiences from the participants, the triumphs from volunteers, and adorable weirdos of all stripes!\n\nS03 E09 – Touch the Fucking Art\n\nRex & D-day interview one of their best goddamned Burning Man friends, Queen Dee. Maybe that’s why there is a lot of goofiness and singing in this one? That said, Burning Man needs an anthem (but not the Ayn Rand “Anthem,” because fuck that neurotic, hypocritical, rape-apologist-ing POS.) There’s Sparklepony drift, Fucking Unicorns, Skinny Kitty, Speleo Crew at Apogaea, and Ice Pirates rigging The Pier. The Scamp is better than the Freebird is better than the Prowler. We’re planning a lot of tours. Really weird Rangers. Also, we all make a lot of excuses for not seeing the thing in the box. Plus, Old Man Burning Man and the Cubatron.\n\nS03 E10 – How to Explode the Theme\n\nThe pride and problems of what very well may be the oldest continuous theme camp on the playa, Bioluminat/Bike Mutation/Pimp My Bike camp place. The importance of camp infrastructure. Suldrew is not his playa name, but he does have a lot of Chinar. Less shit, more fun, especially during setup week. Anyone who’s anyone has abandoned evaporation. You’re theme-ing it wrong, a lot about camp kitchens, and Suldrew looks familiar, but so does D-Day. Plus, Suldrew calls the playa a floor!\n\nThe Accuracy Third Podcast is given as a gift to the community and funded exclusively by gifts from the community.
