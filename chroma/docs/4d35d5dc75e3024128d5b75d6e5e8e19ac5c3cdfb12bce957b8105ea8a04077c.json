  "content": "The Burning Man Regional Network is a complex ecosystem of interconnected people, communities, and events that bring Burning Man culture to daily life year-round. The Regional Network program includes more than 235 volunteer “Regional Contacts” in 125 communities and 34 countries on four continents. Regional Event organizers produce over 100 locally organized official Regional Events annually.\n\nRegional Contacts connect members of the community and welcome people who wish to learn more about the principles and culture. As a whole, the network connects people through information sharing, locally organized events, and a variety of creative and community building endeavors.\n\nSince its founding 25 years ago, the Burning Man Regional Network has grown from three annual events in Central Texas, Northern California, and Canada to a sprawling global nexus. The Network includes many who have never been to Black Rock City but identify with the culture and its local manifestations. As mentioned in our previous Journal post, the Burning Man Regional Network team is taking this 25th anniversary as an opportunity to celebrate and consider how to build an even more badass, creative and resilient network!\n\nBurning Man Project is collaborating with Regional communities to update and design the global network with an eye toward the next 25 years — and beyond. The 25 to Thrive project aims to clarify the purpose and vision for the Regional Network and identify focus areas to build upon strengths, address challenges, and imbue the network with a renewed sense of limitless possibility.\n\nProject by and for Network Participants\n\nFor the exploratory phase of this project, 18 project team members and seven project advisors from 12 countries came together to reflect on the network. This group included network stakeholders and those with experience participating in other networks. 25 to Thrive is using a human-centered design approach, which begins with listening to folks and reviewing years of data gathered from Regional Contacts, official Regional Event organizers and in-depth interviews.\n\nWhen asked about a desired future state, both Regional Contacts (RCs) and official Regional Event Producers cited: more resources and infrastructure, more community connectivity, and more geographic diversity or growth as key characteristics of the future network. RCs stated greater diversity and inclusiveness as part of their vision. Both groups desired more cultural growth, more art, more civic involvement in the world, and greater sustainability — both environmental and economic. We also discussed in depth what areas of the network might benefit from decentralization, and others from centralization. Not surprisingly, there were differences of opinion, but a lot of agreement about the Regional Network’s importance.\n\nWe’d love to know what you think. We are especially interested in hearing from those who do not feel connected with the network currently, and young members of our community who represent the future. What would your dream network be and be doing? Complete this survey to share your input.\n\nRight now, the Burning Man Regional Network is mostly geographically based, event-focused, and relies heavily on volunteer Regional Contacts and official Regional Event organizers to help connect the community year-round. They, along with a small team at Burning Man Project, do their best to share best practices and helpful information, create opportunities for more people to connect to their authentic selves, protect the culture from being commodified, and spotlight interesting ways the culture shows up in the world.\n\nWhat are we not doing that we might consider, and how might we connect people year-round in ways that help the culture fully flourish — and do so sustainably? If this interests you, then read on.\n\nMoving Ahead with Three Areas of Focus\n\nThe 25 To Thrive project team helped identify three broad focus areas: “Network Structure and Collaboration,” “Community Building and Support,” and “Communications and Technology.” The first will consider if there are better, more collaborative organizational structures the network might take. The second will focus on the knowledge, skills, and tools needed to nurture the community. The third will explore communication and technology in a connective way that remains rooted in authentic human relationships.\n\nWe have identified subtopics under each focus area. Under the first focus area are two sub-topics: “Network Structure and Decision Making” and “Funding and Resources.” Under the second focus area, the two subtopics are “Training Resources” and “Participant Engagement through Training, Gatherings, and Programs.”\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nWe want to hear more from people who can offer new perspectives and have not yet participated in this project or connected deeply with the Regional Network (e.g. awesome humans without an RC or Regional Event organizer role). We particularly want to hear from newer community members, those who are under 30 years of age, artists/year-round theme camp organizers, and those residing in Africa.
