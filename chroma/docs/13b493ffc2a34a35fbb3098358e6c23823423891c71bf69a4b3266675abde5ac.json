  "content": "The race to build the Temple of Promise is coming down to the wire, and it needs more funds to bring this ambitious project to life. The Temple is the spiritual core of Black Rock City, and by helping create it, you can touch the heart of everyone there. Please donate now. If you do, you’ll feel the pride of being part of one of our culture’s best stories.\n\nThis story has been told before, but a culture’s best stories should be told over and over again. Here’s one version:\n\nThere once were some artists who had lost a friend. Out of their pain came a beautiful idea that never existed before. The artists lived in a city in the desert that only existed for one week a year. The beautiful idea was a temple on the very edge of the city, where people could go if the city center got to be too much for them. So they built it. And the people came to the temple when the city got to be too much for them, and they smiled, and they cried, and they left prayers and messages and offerings, and at the end of the week, the temple burned up in a great fire as the rest of the city disappeared.\n\nThe next year, when the city came back into being, the temple was still there. It was a different temple, but it was the same Temple.\n\nFifteen years later, the Temple still appears in Black Rock City every year. But it doesn’t appear suddenly, by magic. It takes months and months of work. It takes hundreds of hands and thousands of dollars and tons and tons of materials. The people of the city have to come together, pool their resources, volunteer their time, and spread the word far and wide in order for the Temple to be there when everyone gets to Black Rock City.\n\nAre you going to Black Rock City? Have you ever been? Do you want to go someday? Then the Temple needs your help.\n\nThis year’s Temple crew has raised a bunch of their funds and put in tons of work. They still need more. After their first successful campaign, they’ve launched another crowd-funding campaign to show us how far they’ve come and enlist our help in carrying them the rest of the way. Soon, they’re going to ask again for more help with a precious, specific piece they’re building, and all who have ever fallen in love with a Temple will want to be a part of it.\n\nPlease donate to the new Temple of Promise Indiegogo campaign today, and stay tuned for more ways you can help.\n\nThose who are interested in giving large, tax-deductible gifts to the Temple of Promise can do so on templeofpromise.org.",
