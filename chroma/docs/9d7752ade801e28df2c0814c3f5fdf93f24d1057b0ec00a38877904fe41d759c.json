  "content": "The Man burns in 106 days! As we inch closer to the event in the desert, we know folks have been eagerly anticipating an update on the Secure Ticket Exchange Program. Read on for information on how you can sign up, and how you can get tickets for the younger Burners in your crew. For full Burning Man ticket information, please visit tickets.burningman.org. Lastly, we continue to hear your voices and concerns around this year’s Main Sale. Have a look at our previous post which gives some context for what happened, and includes a link to a statement from ShowClix.\n\nSTEP!\n\nThe Secure Ticket Exchange Program (STEP) is now open for those wanting to return their 2019 Burning Man tickets to the community! STEP will open for ticket requests on Tuesday, May 21, 2019 at 12pm (noon) PDT.\n\nNOTE: Only those who purchased tickets through their Burner Profile will see the option to sell through STEP. If you did not purchase tickets through your Burner Profile, the link to STEP will not appear until it opens for ticket buyers on Tuesday, May 21, 2019 at 12pm (noon) PDT.\n\nThere are some exciting changes to our beloved STEP. This year we’re working with an independent company founded by passionate Burners called Lyte designed to keep tickets circulating within the community while eliminating scalpers and fraud. Even though STEP is being run through Lyte, it can still only be accessed via Burner Profiles.\n\nAmong the improvements this change offers us: we no longer have to limit the exchange to only $425 tickets, and we’ll be able to keep the program open much longer. Read the full details on the STEP page.\n\nKids Tickets!\n\nKids have been an important part of Burning Man since the beginning. In order to better support young Burners coming to the playa with their families, we offer no-cost Kids Tickets for children 12 years old and younger. All kids entering Black Rock City need to have a Kids Ticket, which is only valid in conjunction with their parent or guardian’s regular ticket or access credential. Get your Kids Tickets here.\n\n(Top photo by SN Jacobson)",
