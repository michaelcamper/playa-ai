  "title": "Call for Submissions: Burning Man 2013 Sticker Design Project",
  "author": "Burning Man Project",
  "dateISO": "2013-05-31T12:09:49-07:00",
  "content": "This is the official call for designs for the 2013 Burning Man stickers! Your design could be the one passed out with the materials you receive as you pass through the Greeters Station upon entering Black Rock City. Other designs will become official sticker schwag passed out on-and-off the playa throughout the year. Help us remember our wonderful home in the desert even when we’re away throughout the year. So, don’t hesitate. Participate! Thank you and good luck!\n\nSize: Your designs must use one of the three die sizes:\n\n• 2. 5″ x 5.75” with a 0.125” corner radius\n• 3″ x 3″” square with a 0.062” corner radius\n• 3” Diameter Circle\n\nDesign: Whichever type of sticker tickles your fancy (or maybe you’re very ticklish and want to enter several designs), remember there IS a theme, and we like stickers that attempt to reference Burning Man’s annual art theme. Read up on this year’s (admittedly easy to misinterpret) Cargo Cult theme! And possibly more importantly, this long but important post about it.\n\nThe design MUST incorporate both the name Burning Man and the year 2013.\n\nColors:\n• If using 1-3 colors, set up the file to print as PMS\n• If using 4 or more colors, set up the file to print as CMYK\n\nPriority: Round stickers are given priority for winning the coveted “Gate Sticker” spot, going out to ALL Black Rock Citizens. Other sticker sizes are printed out and handed out to volunteers throughout the year both in Black Rock City and at other Regional events.\n\nSubmitting your Art: Send either a PDF file OR (preferably) the original Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file to stickers@burningman.com. You must OUTLINE all fonts. Whether sending your design or questions, please put your first and last name in the subject header as well as the phrase “2013 Sticker Submission”.\n\nDeadline: Friday, June 21. No art is accepted after this date. Thank you!",
