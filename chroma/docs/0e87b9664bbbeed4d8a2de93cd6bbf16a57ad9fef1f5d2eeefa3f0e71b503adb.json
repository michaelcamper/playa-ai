  "content": "In Black Rock City — perhaps like nowhere else — stickers have power.\n\nOn one hand, they’re works of art you can affix to anything, thereby making that thing into a new work of art, too. Neither of these needs to be “good” to be appreciated in BRC.\n\nAnd on the other hand, stickers are a useful material. Who among us has not taped the sole of a shoe back on with 12 stickers at Burning Man, I ask you? What better than stickers to cover up corporate logos on water bottles and stuff, so we can pretend like they fell from the sky or something?\n\nAt Burning Man Project, we understand the value of stickers. That’s why we print hundreds of thousands of them and hand them out like candy.\n\nBut you’re the ones putting them all over your stuff, so you’d be wise to exercise some agency over what we print on the stickers. I mean, imagine what kinds of horrible things we’d put on there if we didn’t give anyone else a say. Nevertheless, each year we pick 15 or so sticker designs submitted by artists like you, and we print oodles of your art to be disseminated around the city. Your mama will be so proud.\n\nNow, remember, there is a theme, and if your sticker has at least something to do with it, it’s more likely to get sticker-fied. As you contemplate, make sure you read up about the Burning Man 2018 theme: I, ROBOT.\n\nInterested in making one of the most popular gifts in the very gift-y town of Black Rock? Here are the specs for submitting your design(s).\n\nDesign Specs:\n\nYour design(s) will need to be one of three die sizes:\n\nYou must OUTLINE all fonts.\n\nIf using 1–3 colors, set up the file to print as PMS. If using 4 or more colors, set up the file to print as CMYK.\n\nDesigner Tips ‘n’ Tricks:\n\nRound stickers are given priority for being selected as the coveted “Greeter Sticker”, which goes out to ALL Black Rock Citizens. Including both the name “Burning Man” or “Black Rock City” and the year 2018 in your design gets you extra awesome brownie points (and a better chance of your image being used for the Gate Design).\n\nSubmitting Your Art:\n\nSend either a PDF file OR (preferably) the original Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file to stickers@burningman.org. Whether sending your design or questions, please put your first and last name in the subject header as well as the phrase “2018 Sticker Submission”.\n\nDeadline:\n\nMonday, May 28. No art can be accepted after this date!\n\nTop photo by Susan Becker",
