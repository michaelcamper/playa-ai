  "content": "What up my moop maniacs & line sweepers extraordinaire!\n\nFor the past couple of days, we’ve been gleefully celebrating Black Rock City’s successful inspection, meaning Burning Man 2016 is like. SO. on. However, many of you don’t yet know how your individual camps scored! It is time to release the penultimate iteration of the Moop Map: Day Seven is here for you.\n\nFirst, though, I want to continue introducing you to a few of the fascinating people of Resto. (Read about Major Buzzkill, DA, Pocket and Rando if you haven’t yet).\n\nIn truth, the reason I keep coming back to this place is for the people. THESE people. And today I’m sharing a story from one of the seriously undersung heroes of Burning Dude: Mr. Blue. This is a man who, if he took a day off, the whole thing might actually implode.\n\nMr. Blue’s current job titles:\n\nI believe he’s the most managerial manager in the Borg. But what’s cool about Blue is that he’s a really good dude, and that’s why he ended up with all the titles. He just kept volunteering. To wit:\n\nThanks Blue for all you do! Now let’s see the map!\n\nIf the cockles of your heart weren’t warmed by that story, well then let’s see if this Moop Map can spark a little flame in your soul. Because, folks, it’s really starting to look GOOD around here.\n\nGood, though not perfect. No matter what neighborhood you were in, no matter how much time you spent mooping this year, the dust dunes held surprises for everyone. It was a year where raking out your camp was the only way to find all the moop – and even if you did that, you could have missed it.\n\nRemember, Black Rock City, Playa Restoration has your back. You just keep throwing an awesome party and cleaning it up, and we’ll come through and restore the playa. That’s the deal, and we’re all in it together!\n\nI’ll have the remainder of the map in just a couple of days. For now, thank you, and thank Blue, for being awesome in every way. We sure do love ya.",
