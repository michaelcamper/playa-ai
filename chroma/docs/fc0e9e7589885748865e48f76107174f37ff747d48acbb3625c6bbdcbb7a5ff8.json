  "content": "As you finish checking all the things off of your packing list and you turn that final corner toward Black Rock City 2023, take a moment to ask yourself: Are you really coming to Burning Man to live stream and post yourself all over the internet?\n\nWe’ve all seen the endless deluge of photos and videos from BRC, and perhaps that’s what is drawing you to the dusty metropolis — you may want your own slice of what you see folks on Instagram or TikTok are experiencing. Once you get out there though, you’ll quickly notice there’s a lot more going on than live streaming yourself dancing on an art car. It’s someone’s idea of fun, sure, but there are a million other unreproducible ways to experience yourself at the Burn that are wild and completely, utterly unique.\n\nAnd it begins with putting your phone away. You can do it. Just turn it off and leave it wherever you slept last night. Good. Now get on your bike, put a huge smile on your face and take a ride wherever your heart sends you.\n\nYou may be so enchanted by your adventures you’ll stop scouting for the perfect photo op. Good work. Wait a minute, what’s that tiny camp offering anyway? Freshly baked cookies? And arm wrestling? Say hello. Drop in and explore. Next thing you know, you’re meandering into someone’s tiny art gallery and listening to stand-up comedy accompanied by your new best friend. They invite you back to their camp, which is in fact a castle filled with teddy bears, and what the heck happened? You’re singing show tunes and serving pancakes to the hungry masses at sunrise. Gosh, you’re really in it now.\n\nIt happened because you decided to inhabit your experience rather than document it. Burning Man is not a photo op. It’s YOU sharing your wondrous self and imagination with the 80,000 people who are already here, diving into the Immediacy and serendipity of the moment.\n\nDon’t take our word for it. Watch this delightful video by Alex K. Colby and Alicia Sully that encourages us all to use technology thoughtfully — in BRC and everywhere else.\n\nOk. Phones are not all bad. Here in Black Rock City, there are a few ways that using a phone can enhance your experience. Burners have created free, nonprofit apps you can download ahead of time and use offline to navigate and find fun things to do. These apps — which include: Time to Burn, a guide to camps, events, music and more; iBurn, an unofficial offline map, compass, and guide; and Unofficial BRC Map, where camps and artists can drop their locations — were developed to serve Burners in a way that enhances the Immediacy of their experiences.\n\nOf course, your phone is a great device to snap fun pics and videos of you and your friends too. Go ahead and document your experience, provided you’re sharing within your own circles and not using any imagery for commercial purposes. BUT good lord, there is no need to create live streams, Instagram stories, or TikToks of your Burning Man experience in real time from the playa. Blech. You’re cooler than that. Live in the moment and fill up your cup with wildly fun and interesting experiences that are yours and yours alone. They’ll make for great stories afterwards, and they’ll be yours to tell.\n\nWe promise you, as humans who have done this Burning Man thing a few times ourselves, that YOU need to take charge of your experience. The first step involves embracing the moment, and engaging with the humans and adventures immediately around you. There’s plenty of time to scroll, and click, and TikTok, when you’re back home living your life. (Unless of course you get pulled into building that ridiculous project for Burning Man 2024 with all your new best friends who you met on playa when you were living in the moment.)\n\n(Cover photo by Bill Klemens)",
