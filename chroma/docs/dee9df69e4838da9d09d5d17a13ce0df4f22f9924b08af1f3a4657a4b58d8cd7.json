  "content": "We thought you might like to get a look at some of the people working in the desert to get everything ready for Burning Man.\n\nWe don’t have pictures of everyone, and we’re sorry about that, but we’ll continue to collect them as we move around. … You may have seen a few of them previously along the way, but here they are all in one place. And we’re sorry that we don’t have ALL the names to go with all the pictures, but we’re working on it.\n\nSo when you come out for the party and you see one of these folks, give a wave and maybe a thank you!",
