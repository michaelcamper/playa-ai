  "content": "If you are reading this, there’s a good chance you consider yourself “a Burner.” Maybe you’re in the 4% of our population who have attended more than 11 Burns. Maybe you’ve never been to Black Rock City. Regardless, you seem to be curious about Burning Man.\n\nWho are Burners?\nWhere are we from?\nWhat do we have in common?\nHow are we different from each other?\nHow have we changed?\n\nIf you wonder about these things and have an affinity for numbers, we’ve got good news. The latest Black Rock City Census data is now available! If you attended the Burn in 2016 we hope you were one of thousands of participants who filled out our online survey after returning from the playa. If so, way to go! You helped make our analytical dreams come true so we can provide statistically reliable and valid estimates concerning the BRC population.\n\nIf you went to Burning Man in 2016 but did not fill out the online survey, please consider telling us why by filling out this short survey (yes, I see the irony here).\n\nDid you know... the last few years there were three times as many Canadians on the playa than in previous years. People living in Canada made up 6.7% of the Black Rock City population in 2016. Welcome Canucks!\n\nAlso interesting… over 70% of Burners do not identify with a particular religion; however, 46.5% consider themselves spiritual.\n\nBurners are not getting any older… or younger. The median age in Black Rock City has been 33 or 34 years old for the past four years. Census Lab had the pleasure of hosting a three-week old newborn baby Burner volunteer this past year. Only one half of one percent (0.5%) of the population in 2016 was under the age of 13.\n\nBurners like to learn. 43.1% of 2016 attendees had a Bachelor’s degree — more than double the US average according to 2015 US Census data (US Census Bureau. \"CPS Historical Time Series Tables.\"). 31.3% of 2016 attendees have a Graduate degree (compared to a 12% US average in 2015).\n\nWould you like to know more interesting facts about our fabulous, fun culture? If so, you have several options:\n\nWritten by “Chipper” McKay\nEdited by Sarah “Picky” Williamson, Dana “DV8” DeVaul, and Gretchen Bennett\n\nTop image: Playa by air, 2016 (photo by “Chipper” McKay)",
