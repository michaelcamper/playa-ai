  "content": "I’d heard this story before, but now it has a sticker, so it’s a real thing\n\nYears ago, “Hot Damn,” a member of the Eggs Bar team, had an epic playa meltdown. Her camp took great care of her, but after it was all over they agreed her punishment was that for the next day her name would be changed to “Hot Mess.”\n\nLater, the day on which that happened became known as “Hot Mess Day.” As in, “was that before or after Hot Mess Day?”\n\nSome time later, one of the crew noticed the degree to which “Hot Mess Day” sounds similar to the traditional Hindu greeting “Namaste” — which roughly translates as “The divinity in me bows to the divinity in you.”\n\nAt which point they decided that the world needed a word like “Hotmessday” — the mess in me bows to the mess in you.\n\nIt was a private camp joke until, this year, they made stickers and started spreading them around.\n\n“I’m really happy about it, because not only is it hilarious but it represents a time when my camp did take excellent care of me. When they were there for me even when I couldn’t offer them anything, or be there for myself, and that’s a very powerful and happy memory for me,” Hot Damn said.  “A good experience that came out of a horrible time.”\n\nAnd I don’t know about you, but I feel like “hotmessday” is the greeting we so desperately need. An admission, up front, right at the beginning, that we are a mess and struggling with our stuff, and this is okay. I think Burning Man, and all our lives, are better if we just stop pretending to be so together, and instead we start struggling together.\n\n“Turning it into something we could laugh about together turned this terrible experience for me into something we could talk about together, without shame,” Hot Damn said. “That was a very moving gift to me, and I’m hoping that now other people can have it too.”\n\nBeginning in Burning Man 2019, the mess in me bows to the mess in you.",
