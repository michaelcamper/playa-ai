Rather than head towards the nursing homes of Reno, the elders in this dusty Western hamlet pretty much decided to hunker down and stick together. A Senior Center was created, where they can rely on each other for support, which allows them to live at their own homes for what seems like longer than most old folks get to, or maybe ‘til the last, as most of us would prefer.\n\nWeekday lunches and frequent activities with your friends? Constant contact with your support network? Sounds like a better way to spend those golden years than locked in a bleak hospital for the aging, somewhere far away from the ones you love.\n\nThis writer had lunch with the regulars at the Senior Center on Friday, and it was sweet and delicious — cooked by Miss Schatzi, the Center’s director, chef, and all-around “mom” to the elders in town. The bright and sunny Senior Center features an industrial kitchen, a dining room, and a lounge / living room / library where they play Bingo; lively conversation and laughter filled the room.\n\nMiss Schatzi would like to be able to make repairs on the place, but there are no tools to be had at the Senior Center yet — not even a screwdriver, she says. And during those weekday lunches, Schatzi plates up hot servings one at a time back in the kitchen and runs them out to the seated Seniors herself. Consequently, she’d love a rolling food-warmer (restaurant-grade) to be able to serve lunch to her crew of a dozen-to-eighteen simultaneously, so the seniors can sit down and eat together.\n\nAs far as access to the outside world goes, Burning Man LLC has blanketed the whole town of Gerlach with free WiFi signal year-round — but the old folks have yet to take advantage of teaching themselves how to use the Internet because they don’t have a computer at the Senior Center. Similarly, the Seniors enjoy Gerlach’s movie nights, thrown by Taz in Bruno’s Restaurant back room, but they can’t hear as well — so they’d like to watch movies in their own clubhouse, at the volume of their choice, but they have no TV and no DVD player.\n\nThese are modern conveniences some of us take for granted, situated as many of us are in relative comfort, in or near consumer-goods-laden towns full of Craigslist scores to be had whenever we need something new or gently used. Obtainium (i.e. that which others throw away) is everywhere — in the cities. Gerlach is an isolated place, but maybe with a little help, the lovely Seniors in town can be outfitted in the manner to which they should be accustomed.\n\nYou see where we’re going with this, of course. It’s just the Burning Man / Cacophony Society community is so good at Tom Sawyering up whatever needs conjuring …   So hey, if anyone’s got any of the below wish-list items to donate, as well as a way to get said items to the Center, then read on.\n\nOf course, capital donations would also empower the Seniors to make their clubhouse a home, because bills always need paying. One way or another, many hands might make light work in causing the Gerlach seniors to be as comfortable and happy as you’d want your own grandparents to be. [*cough* techies w/ $ *cough*]\n\nMail checks, shipped items, or even greeting cards to: Gerlach Senior Center, PO Box 69 (yes. really. 69. yes really) Gerlach, NV 89412. Not sure how they’d receive a credit card donation as they’re not online yet.\n\nPlease, if you’ve got a wish-list somethin’ for the seniors, *CONTACT* MISS SCHATZI before August 24 at the Senior Center, (775) 557-2206. That means don’t just come bearing gifts without having spoken to her. She says there’s a boring outgoing message she can’t figure out how to change, but leave a message for her anyway.\n\nOf course let’s not just drop off donations at the Center door — that’s uncool — and let’s not offer to bring her anything less than the best and non-brokenest things. If Burning Man participants are going to disrupt the Gerlach seniors’ sightline once a year, then at least maybe we can style out their clubhouse ‘til they forgive us for being so weird and loud sometimes.
