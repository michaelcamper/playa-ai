  "content": "Danger Ranger was the first to draw a line in the dust, and he announced that across that line, everything would be different. Today, there is still a line that separates the default world from Black Rock City, and it’s active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nWe are Gate, Perimeter & Exodus.\n\nAll BRC citizens will have first encountered us, had their car searched and their tickets torn, but so often that memory dissolves before they reach the Greeter stations about two miles farther down Gate road. Some of you reading this may have just remembered that we’re not the same as Greeters. That’s okay, we actually like being able to disappear from your memory like that. Next time though, keep an eye out for us. We’re dressed in black, working tirelessly around the clock so this temporary city can exist, and doing it miles outside the Perimeter, away from the lights, music, cameras, and action.\n\nWe are a huge and very busy department, working day and night in some of the most extreme conditions on the planet. To try and summarize what almost two dozen sub-departments are doing is impossible, but whether it’s processing arrivals at Gate, scanning the Perimeter for unannounced guests, pulsing everybody out of the city at the end of the week, or any of the jobs connecting these tasks, we’re doing it before you arrive and still doing it after you leave.\n\nIf you’re looking for a different kind of way to get involved in Black Rock City’s future, and you want to help make everyone’s journeys safer, consider volunteering with us.\n\nThough we may sometimes wear the make up, actual clowns need not apply.\n\nWe have comprehensive training for every area. Training takes place on playa, during the event.\n\nWork three shifts to earn a department shirt! (Other perks may or may not exist)\n\nYou must have visited Burning Man at least once before, and you must have your own ticket to join GP&E.\n\nIf you are interested, please:",
