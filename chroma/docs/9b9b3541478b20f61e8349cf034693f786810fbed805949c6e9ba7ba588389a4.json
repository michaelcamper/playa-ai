  "content": "Burner Express Bus tickets are on sale now, and there’s some new info for 2017! Since last year was a resounding success, we will offer water sales and entry on Saturday pre-event without a Work Access Pass again. There will once again be a late-summer sale of (now 1,000) Burner Express Bus Plus tickets that include the option to buy a $425 ticket to the event.\n\nBurner Express Bus tickets can be purchased on the Burner Express website. You must have a valid Burning Man ticket, Will Call confirmation number, or other valid entry credential to board a Burner Express Bus. A Burner Express bus ticket alone will not allow you to enter Black Rock City.\n\nThe Burner Express Bus offers transportation from downtown San Francisco and Reno-Tahoe International Airport to Black Rock City with departures from Saturday, August 26 through Thursday, August 31.\n\nLuggage is limited to two pieces with a maximum total dimension of 62 linear inches each (total sum of length+width+height) plus a carry-on item. You may also bring a bike, but you must purchase the bike add-on for an additional fee.\n\nAt the end of Burning Man, the Burner Express Bus will take you from Black Rock City to the Reno International Airport or downtown San Francisco, bypassing Exodus traffic through a dedicated exit. Departures from the playa begin Friday, September 1 through Tuesday September 5 with several departure times.\n\nPurchase water in advance\n\nBurner Express Bus passengers can purchase water in advance and fill up on the playa. You must bring your own container (we recommend collapsible five-gallon containers so they fit in your luggage). Water must be filled upon arrival in BRC and is only available to Burner Express riders. The cost is $1.50 per gallon. You must purchase water in advance. There will be no on-site sales.\n\nNo Work Access Pass (formerly known as Early Arrival pass) needed for Saturday, Aug. 26 arrivals\n\nIf you take the Burner Express Bus arriving Saturday, August 26, your Burner Express Bus ticket is what allows you early arrival. If you’re not part of a placed camp, you may only camp between G Street and L Street outside of the blue flags. Blue flags in the ground mark off reserved camping; do not camp within blue flags. You are welcome to camp in HOVerlandia at 6:15 and I, a dedicated reserved space for those arriving via the Burner Express Bus.\n\nYou are not allowed to reserve camping space for people who have not arrived yet. If you are found holding space, someone from the Placement Team will move your belongings and remove any markers or boundaries you have set up.\n\nBurner Express Bus Plus tickets\n\nIn our ongoing effort to reduce car traffic to the event and encourage alternative transportation, we’ll be selling 1,000 Burner Express Bus Plus tickets on June 14 at 12 pm (noon) Pacific Time. Once you purchase your Burner Express Bus Plus ticket, you will have a bus ticket and will receive an email confirmation and payment link for your Burning Man ticket. You will need to pay for your Burning Man ticket before picking it up at the point of embarkation in San Francisco when you check in for your bus.\n\nThat’s worth repeating: Burner Express Bus Plus is a Burner Express Bus ticket plus an opportunity to buy a $425 (+9% tax) Burning Man event ticket for your use in conjunction with your bus ticket. The event ticket is only valid if you ride the Burner Express Bus — you cannot use the ticket to enter Black Rock City via any other method of transportation. If you have additional questions about Burner Express Bus Plus tickets, please see the Ticket Support page. (Don’t email ticketing! Do what that page says!)\n\nPro tips:\n\nTake the time to read the FAQ before you buy your tickets. This will eliminate any questions you may have during the buying process and help your buying experience go smoothly.",
