  "content": "Got some word back on how things went with the recycling program at Albertsons in Reno from Nathan Heller, who helped make this whole deal happen.\n\nSome numbers of total volume of recyclables from all stores:\n\nAluminum and tin — 600 lbs\n\nPlastics — 48 watermelon bins full\n\nGlass — 14 watermelon bins\n\nCardboard — 35 pallets (much of which was taken from burners as they were shopping to go to BRC)\n\nBicycles — two dozen, 8 of which were reusable, rest went for parts…\n\nPaper — 4 pallets\n\nWow–great start! We’ve heard that at least 6 of the 7 stores that participated will be doing the same again next year, which means ya’ll did a great job of keeping the trash out and the recycling well organized–thank you to everyone who participated!\n\nAnd we’ve also heard that the sourcing of greener materials @ the stores was a success as well, also welcome news.\n\nSo, the news keeps dribbling in, and it continues to be good!",
