  "content": "This is the official call for designs for 2020 Black Rock City stickers! What do stickers even look like in the infinite realities of The Multiverse? Which wormhole will your creativity crawl through to reach our dusty paws on playa this year?\n\nYour design could be the one passed out with the materials you receive at the Greeters Station upon entering Black Rock City. Other designs might become official sticker swag passed out on-and-off the playa throughout the year. Help us remember our wonderful desert home even when we’re away throughout the year.\n\nIf you plan to submit a design, please read through the requirements below. We can’t print the sticks if you don’t meet the specs!\n\nDesign Specs:\n\nYour design(s) will need to be one of three die sizes:\n\nYou must OUTLINE all fonts, meaning vector text is no longer a font but rather is vector shapes. This eliminates issues for the printer not having the font.\n\nIf using 1–3 colors, set up the file to print as PMS. If using four or more colors, set up the file to print as CMYK.\n\nDesigner Tips ‘n’ Tricks:\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nSubmitting Your Art:\n\nDeadline:\n\nFriday, May 1. No art can be accepted after this date!\n\n(Top photo by Robert Bruce Anderson)",
