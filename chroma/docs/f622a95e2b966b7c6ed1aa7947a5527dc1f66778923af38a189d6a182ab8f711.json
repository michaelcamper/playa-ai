  "content": "Guess what! If you thought it was too late to get tickets for the Burner Express Bus, you were right… until now! Bus ticket sales have been extended while supplies last. So book passage now!\n\nThe Burner Express Bus is, quite simply, the most pleasant and convenient way for someone without a ton of stuff to travel to and from Black Rock City. Don’t believe me? How about some testimonials from last year?\n\nI’m not just blowing smoke here; I’m taking the Burner Express Bus out of BRC on Monday Sept. 5 myself. So if you want to be in a bunch of ridiculous Burning Man bus selfies, I recommend the last bus out of town.",
