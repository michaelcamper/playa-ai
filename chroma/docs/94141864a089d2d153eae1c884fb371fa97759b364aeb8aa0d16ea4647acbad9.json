  "content": "Congratulations to the 2015 grantees!\n\nBurning Man is proud to announce the new cohort of Global Art Grant recipients! Over the last 14 years, the grants committee (formerly operating under the Black Rock Arts Foundation) has refined its funding priorities, criteria, outreach and methods of selection, enabling the most inventive, fresh, and unique projects to rise to the top.\n\nThis program has always prioritized funding projects that bring people together in unexpected ways, that encourage exchange of skill, knowledge and inspiration, and that benefit the community at large. This crop of grantees is sure to meet these aims with flying colors! The Burning Man Arts crew is delighted at the range of innovative designs, unusual employment of media and materials, and extreme emphasis on collaboration these projects exhibit.\n\nAs you know, 2015 has been a year of growth and expansion for Burning Man. Last summer, when Black Rock Arts Foundation’s existing programs were combined with Burning Man’s Art Department to create the Burning Man Arts program, the grants committee was finally able to increase funding to projects worldwide. This year, the committee awarded more funding to more projects than any year previous: $100,000 total to 18 projects. This is one step closer to our vision of making inclusive, collaborative, and transformative public art accessible and available to everyone!\n\nMany congratulations to the new grantees, and welcome to the Burning Man Arts family!\n\nCheck out these amazing public art projects that are happening all over the world, all year-long. From site-specific galleries on a frozen lake to a floating sculptural island in the Philippines, these projects are sure to enchant and inspire you. They are sharing Burning Man’s core values with a diverse range of communities, bringing interactive art experiences to people in their everyday lives, moving way beyond the boundaries of economic and social standing and access to traditional arts venues. Art is for everyone!",
