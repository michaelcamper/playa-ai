Here’s a little collection of this and that, pics that fell through the cracks. … And hey, keep those cards and letters coming! BRC is kind of a lonely outpost right now, and when there’s an announcement at the morning meeting that “you’ve got mail!’ — the real kind, the kind you can touch and feel — well, it’s a pretty good thing. So make the people you’re missing feel good; send them a note or a lollipop or whatever. It’ll make their day.\n\nOk, here we go!",
