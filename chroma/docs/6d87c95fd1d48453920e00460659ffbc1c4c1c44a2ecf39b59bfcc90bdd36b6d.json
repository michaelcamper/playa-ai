  "content": "I’ve seen some online conversations dismissing the importance of the Decommodification Principle.   “Who cares if people do photo shoots of their products at Burning Man?” “Burning Man is changing, you can’t fight the tide.”\n\nWha??

A wall built on Principles and maintained by a community working to fend off the cultural erosion of a marketing-infected world.\n\nAt the Theme Camp Symposium this year in Oakland, they showed this video of Burners explaining what Decommodification means, and why it is so important.",
