  "content": "As you come through the gate at this year’s Burning Man event, along with the What Where When, Tip Sheet and map, you’ll get something new from the Greeters – a little pink postcard that’s part of an interactive, social-digital-anthropological experiment we’re about to embark upon.\n\nThere is space on the card for you to fill out your name, email, Twitter account, whether you’re male or female, and your zip code or country. That’s it.\nYou can drop it off at several locations around the playa.\n\nPretty easy, right?\n\nBut why? And what’s up? Simply put, there has never been much of a reason or motivation to attempt to identify who attended the event until now. We all know what a strong and dynamic community of artists, performers, makers, and Burners has grown up on the playa. Until now, the social connectivity that’s accompanied that growth has been completely organic.\n\nWith this Pink Post Card project we want to gather information to help map the Burning Man future on and off the playa, and cultivate our culture. We’re asking you to opt-in to the project because you enjoy the event and want to help shape its future and that which is beyond Black Rock City.\n\nBurning Man is constantly evolving and adapting. But recently we have encountered renewed challenges, and in response we need to improve our network of relationships and to (among other things) allow the people familiar with the experience and values to connect around important issues.\n\nThough we have collected information in the past as part of the ticket purchase process, the BRC Census, or for the distribution of the Jack Rabbit Speaks, those mechanisms don’t reflect the “now” of actually being on the playa as a collective experience for a moment in time. It’s important to point out that we’ve always been vigilant about respecting personal information as it was shared in the intended context at that time. We will continue to maintain the same level of protection and confidentiality as we have for 15 years for all information shared with us. We won’t share your information unless you choose to do so.\n\nWhat will the Pink Postcard data be used for? Honestly, we’re not sure yet. This is an experiment! A radical self-reliant and expressive civic experiment. We’re trying out some new ideas and trying to solve some complex issues. We suspect that one of the first steps towards doing so is related to gaining a better understanding of who actually attends the event and the related existing connectivity. Fertility 2.0 is the seed. And so are you. We hope you’ll join us.\n\nYou’ll find Pink Collection Boxes at Center Camp, PlayaInfo, BRC\nCensus and at the 3 and 9 o’clock Ranger Outposts. We’ll even gift you a\nsticker in appreciation of your participation if you come to the Census Camp near the Cafe!\n\nThe back of the card is blank, so feel free to use it for comments, a funny picture… whatever you like about Burning Man, how it goes this year, your favorite experience or your thoughts on BRC’s future. We won’t be able to respond, but we will read all of them!\n\nThis post card isn’t your best feedback tool, though, so if you do actually want to provide formalized feedback to the Burning Man organization, feel free to use the Feedback Loop (feedback@burningman.com) listed in September on the Burning Man homepage. It will be enabled after the Man burns.\n\nOh, and why paper and not technology? Because we can, and it just seemed worthy of our cultural approach around immediacy! Be Here Now!\n\nSo, do you like pink?",
