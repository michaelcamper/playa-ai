It’s a jam-packed, awesome schedule of speakers, including local D.C. Burners, Burning Man founders and staff, and excellent Burning Man artists.\n\nJust like the exhibition, this event is open to the public and free of charge. All you need to do is show up! Be sure to join the Facebook event to keep up with any announcements and bring your umbrella (the weather is looking pretty iffy). You can show up anytime throughout the day — the full schedule is on the website. The event will be streamed live, so everybody can watch, even if you aren’t in D.C. Isn’t that awesome? Here’s the link where the stream will be.\n\nIf you’ve wanted to participate in the eye-popping exhibition of Burning Man art and culture at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, now’s your chance. The last day to have the full-blown experience is Sunday, September 16. After that, the ground floor of art gets taken down, but the outdoor installations will stay up through January. Here’s the full schedule of events for the rest of the exhibition.\n\nTop photo by Manuel Pinto",
