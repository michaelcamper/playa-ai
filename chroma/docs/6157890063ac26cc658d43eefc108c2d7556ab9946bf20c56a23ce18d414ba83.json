Tales and adventures are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgotten.”\n— Neil Gaiman\n\nWe love to hate the dust. It gets into everything, it sticks to anything. What it touches is marked for the remainder of it’s  significantly shortened lifespan. I believe we ingest a lot more of it than we imagine. Fighting it — believe me, I’ve tried — is useless.\n\nBut I find that when I quit fighting and embrace the dust, and I mean truly become one with it and of it and in it, it becomes almost impossible to become actually dirty. And my camera gets a magical Shield of Immunity against playa, and so I go out and shoot what the dust reveals.\n\nHawaii CORE project\n\nDusty Couple\n\n“Dust is only a name for what happens when matter begins to understand itself”\n— Phillip Pullman\n\nThe Temple of Transition\n\nDusty Ride\n\nDusty Stroll\n\nSea of Dust\n\n“A man’s very highest moment is, I have no doubt at all, when he kneels in the dust, and beats his breast, and tells all the sins of his life.”\n— Oscar Wilde\n\nMorning Meditation\n\nThey’re going to burn the Trojan Horse in a bit. Gotta go shoot that for sure. As always, more pics on my flickr stream and you can bet I’ll post more as soon as I can.",
