  "content": "Kids have been part of Burning Man since the first gathering on Baker Beach in 1986. Many grown-up Burners are true lifers. There are even multi-generational Burner lineages now. Black Rock City is a family affair for families of all kinds, including those with little ones. The Profiles in Dust team has put together this delightful film about what that’s like for the kids, their parents, and their neighbors in BRC.",
