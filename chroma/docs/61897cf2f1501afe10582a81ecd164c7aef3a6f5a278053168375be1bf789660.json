  "content": "I’m sure we’ve all cringed when a friend or co-worker says, “Burning Man? …that’s like Coachella, right?”\n\nBut it is hardly their fault. There are now TONS of events that are called “Festivals” and it is hard to understand how they differ.\n\nIn this video I talk about the different kinds of Music Festivals, Conferences, Transformational Festivals, and Participatory Gatherings.\n\nNOTE: While I make the case that the participatory nature of Burning Man and sanctioned regionals have a special kind of magic, I did not mean to imply that the others do not have participation.  There is just something incredibly mind-blowing about looking out at the Playa and trying to grok, “So, none of these artists were paid? They created all of this as a gift for US?!”   It shifts something inside us and shatters our models of “audience,” “performer” and “participant.”\n\nDid I miss any categories or important events? Share your thoughts below.\n\n(For a great discussion by some organizers of other Transformational Festivals and how Burning Man influenced them, click here.)",
