  "content": "Hip-hip-HURRAH! Three cheers for YOU, Black Rock City. You did it again. You threw a humdinger of a whizbang, and left without a trace. That’s straight from the mouth of the Bureau of Land Management, who just completed their site inspection. They’re still tabulating the precise results, but at a glance they can tell us that YES, we passed, and Burning Man can happen again next year.\n\nI’ve just returned, dusty and wide-eyed, from the place that was Black Rock City. I walked the inspection myself, along with 20 dedicated Playa Restoration crew members who returned to the desert to see the season through to its triumphant end. How did we do it? We picked up MOOP, of course. What little we could find.\n\nLet’s all give ourselves a big hand, and three more cheers for the Playa Restoration crew! They spent two and a half weeks walking a massive portion of our 3,347-acre site, picking up all those butts and wood chips to bring in another win for the home team.\n\nThanks too to Vertumnus, the fabulous photographer who volunteered many extra hours to document this Restoration team. Here is a slideshow of just a fraction of Vertumnus’ best shots. Please, visit his site to see more. They’re all amazing.\n\nNow, I know we haven’t finished our conversation about the MOOP Map — and now that the inspection’s over, I’m getting ready to address all the remaining questions and concerns! Sit tight and I’ll be back soon to tie up all those loose ends.\n\nThanks again, Black Rock City. There’s no place like home. See you there in 2013.",
