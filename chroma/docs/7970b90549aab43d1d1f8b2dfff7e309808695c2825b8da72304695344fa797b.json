  "content": "While Burning Man has gained a well-earned reputation for being one of the greatest parties in the world, it’s a somewhat lesser known fact that it’s also a crucible for creativity, innovation and intellectual discourse. We’ve done a round-up of all the workshops, talks, conferences (yes, conferences) and other intellectual pursuits happening in Black Rock City this year — turns out there’s a lot of ’em!

You’ll also find a list of academic events on the back of the What Where When guide, which you’ll get at the Greeters Station.\n\n(Please note that as with any “scheduled” event in Black Rock City, your mileage may vary. Camps move, times shift, weather blows things away, and people aren’t 100% reliable … so take this schedule with a grain of salt, and check in with the organizers directly if you want to make sure things are happening when and where you expect them to.)\n\nTitle: “Money Grows on Trees”\nHost: Messenger Joshua & 1worldcurrency.net\nLocation: Shwar Town Camp, 8:30 & D\nTime:\nDescription: Learn the truth about money, how to end usury and deliver the gifting economy to the default world.
