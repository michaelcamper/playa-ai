  "content": "My friend James invited some friends and me to stay with him at Lake Tahoe on the way to Burning Man (2006). We went out on the lake in his dad’s speedboat and were cruising around, having a happy time, when we found some litter floating on the lake. It was a cardboard box that had come unglued and was floating flat on the lake’s surface. We picked it up. Stuck on it was a label: “Masonic Memorial Gardens ……. cremated remains of Donald ……., permit enclosed # …….”\n\nWell, we were a little shocked and surprised. For a few minutes we discussed whether to take the empty box with us or throw it back into the lake. We did not want to re-litter the lake. Then we had a splendid idea! Take the box to Burning Man and place it on the Temple where it (along with other memorials) would be burned. Wow! Don will get to go to Burning Man for his last party!\n\nWe loved the idea, it brought joy to us, and we did it. And that’s how Don got to go with us to Burning Man.\n\nby Steve Engel",
