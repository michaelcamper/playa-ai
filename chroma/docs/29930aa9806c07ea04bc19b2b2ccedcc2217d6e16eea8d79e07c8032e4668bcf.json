  "content": "On December 13, 2011, the Burning Man Special Events Team hosted a free workshop about fundraising for art projects, conducted by yours truly, wearing my art curator / maker / facilitator / supporter hat for the evening.  We’re happy to say that it was well-attended, both in house at Burning Man HQ and online via live webcast.\n\nWe recorded the audio from the workshop [UPDATE: sadly, the audio is no longer available] and uploaded the accompanying Fundraising for Art Projects PowerPoint presentation so those of you who couldn’t attend can still benefit from the information presented. Feel free to share this around, of course … the more people learning how to raise funds for art projects the better.  Here’s the workshop description:\n\nIf you’re interested in learning specifically about applying for Burning Man Art Grants, there’s a workshop coming up soon on that topic … stay tuned for more information.",
