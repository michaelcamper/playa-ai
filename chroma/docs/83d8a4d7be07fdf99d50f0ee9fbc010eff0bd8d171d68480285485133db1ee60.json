In a room on the top floor, a two-by-six-inch plank, painted white, protrudes about five feet through a hole halfway up the wall; in the next room, the other half of the plank emerges, painted black.”It’s called the No-See-Saw,” Zeitounian says. “It’s a play on perception and psychological issues. Who are you trusting when you sit down? You don’t know. So do you sit down anyway?”\n\nThe eponymous man.\n\nPhoto: Mulling it Over via Flickr\n\nZeitounian once had a plan to exhibit the No-See-Saw at an outdoor festival in France, reimagining the piece so the plank would jut through a fabricated, free-standing tree. He would call it the “Tseesaw” — a seesaw in a tree. But last September, when the Burning Man Festival declared that its 2007 art theme, “The Green Man,” would examine humanity’s relationship to nature, Zeitounian changed his destination. He answered the organization’s call for contributors to its 30,000-square-foot “Green Man Pavilion” with a proposal for the Tseesaw. The Burning Man art staff not only approved the project, they gave him “more than a couple of grand” to build it.",
