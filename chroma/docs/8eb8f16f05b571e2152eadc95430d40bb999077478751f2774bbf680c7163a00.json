An accomplished fire performer, she publishes Kindle Magazine, and will attend UC Berkeley’s Boalt Law School in the Fall of 2010. This post is part of the Metropol Blog Series.]\n\nWith the ability to control and harness its energy, both physical and spiritual, humans see fire differently than the rest of the animal kingdom.  We do not run away from it, but often gravitate towards and congregate around it.  We use it as a tool, and some of us like to use it as a toy.  We see it as both dangerous and comforting, painful and powerful.  But what is it that draws us to flames like moths to a lantern?  What is it that makes us, as Burners, surround ourselves with it, play with it, and revere it as we do in Black Rock City?\n\nThe truth is, humans have had a close relationship with fire for many hundreds of thousands of years, over a million years by the count of some scientists.  Some even speculate that harnessing fire and using it to cook food may have been key to our evolution.  Not only were we able to eat a wider variety of foods made softer and safer after cooking and potentially gain more rich protein from cooked meat, we had more time to spend together as people, preparing meals and eating them around the warm fire.\n\nAs our earlier selves sat around the protective flames in the dark night, we began to share ideas, stories, and art.  We drew on caves and invented language to communicate the burning complex ideas trapped in our brains, all while enjoying the warmth of what we once feared and fled from like the rest of the animal kingdom.  We began to ritualize the use of fire, like the forests around us, in cycles of life, death, and rebirth.  Fire is a primal element of our nature as humans, and perhaps that is one of the reasons it is so celebrated in Black Rock City.\n\nWandering around our fair city, the smell of propane, singed arm hair and dreams fill the air.  Like the first humans to wield it, we both revel in our command of fire, and respect its destructive nature.  We swing it around us on chains, shoot it off the roofs of our art cars and send it through the spikes and jaws giant metal serpents.  Others sit around burn barrels through late nights and early mornings, staring into the dancing flames and bearing their souls.  We gather en masse to rejoice in the burning of the Man, the heart of our city, and celebrate the coming of a new year, then sit the next night in silent remembrance around the Temple as we watch our past and future swirl away from the healing fire in giant whirlwinds.\n\nBlack Rock City presents a unique opportunity to make the fire arts an integral part of a civic community, and the result is a culture that coalesces around the warmth of the flames, as our ancient ancestors did around the campfire.  We use it to express ourselves, connect with each other, fill us up and set us free.  We use it in our rituals of creating, burning, and starting again, as well as to share burning ideas and remember our past.  In such a place where we are able to reach down to our cores and share our dreams, we cannot help but be a people with fire in our hearts.",
