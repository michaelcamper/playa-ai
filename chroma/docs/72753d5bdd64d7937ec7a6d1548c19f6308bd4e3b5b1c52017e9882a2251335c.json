  "content": "As previously announced, tickets are not being sold onsite at the Box Office this year. That policy still stands. As is common with the first year of a change in policy, a handful of participants may be caught by surprise as they make final plans. Also, traditionally advance sales have ended the Friday prior to the opening of the event. This was to allow time for the Will Call system to be prepared. Over the past several years we have been working to improve our electronic ticketing system, including computerized Will Call onsite. Our confidence in that system has grown to the point where we can accommodate online sales overlapping with the event opening.\n\nWeâ€™ve heard from burners working to finalize their plans over the coming weekend, who are concerned about the lack of onsite sales, since they may need to arrange rides, get last minute approval for time off work, etc. We still want people to plan ahead and buy their tickets in advance, but feel that we can smooth this transition by extending outlet walk-in and online sales by a few days.\n\nOnline sales will now continue four more days through Tuesday, August 26th at 12:00 PM midnight. Tickets can be purchased here.\n\nBay Area and Sacramento walk-in ticket outlets will continue ticket sales two more days through the end of business day Sunday, August 24th. Our Reno ticket outlet will continue sales four more days through Tuesday, August 26th. For outlet locations and hours visit our tickets page.\n\nAlso, as a reminder all Will Call tickets MUST be collected at the Box Office no later than 12:00 noon Saturday, August 30th.\n\nFor all your ticket questions visit http://tickets.burningman.com.
