  "content": "Now I’m no Census researcher, but I bet if you asked random Burners to name one of the 10 Principles, Leaving No Trace would probably be the one that comes to mind more often than not. It’s one of the easiest things to understand about Black Rock City’s culture, but that doesn’t mean we can take it for granted.\n\nOn the contrary, MOOP is on the rise, and if we don’t get a handle on it, that’s one of the few things that really could put an end to Burning Man (unlike all those other things).\n\nD.A., manager of Playa Restoration, made this video to educate and rally the troops (read: that’s all of us) on the nature of the MOOP problem and how we can stop it. Watch, learn, and share it far and wide.",
