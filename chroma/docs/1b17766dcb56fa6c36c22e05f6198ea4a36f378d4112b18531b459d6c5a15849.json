Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for experiences from the participants, the triumphs from volunteers, and adorable weirdos of all stripes!\n\nS03 E07 – Stories Came Prepared\n\nIf you walked into Stories’s camp, he would hug you, get you a drink, a comfortable chair, and some food. The Playa Puzzle Project 2018 (you don’t need a packet, but you do.) Burners Under the Influence Camp. Our first guest who brought an outline with him. We love Stories, but he loves us more. A promise from D-day. Bollywood music video/Give Camp Bui your email address.\n\nS03 E08 – Rick-ing Down the River\n\nWe feature a lot of volunteers on Accuracy Third, but possibly none more prolific than the eponymous Rick, rolling his way from one volunteer crew to another over the course of almost two decades on playa. Plus, Beth is unimpressed with our new outro script. Also, a gift from Creampie.\n\nAccuracy Third LIVE on May 5 in San Francisco!\n\nAccuracy Third is doing the thing that Accuracy Third does, but LIVE!
