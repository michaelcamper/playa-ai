  "content": "And just like that, it has begun.\n\nIf you came out early to Black Rock City this year, you got a little surprise: They let you in.\n\nThe gates swung open Sunday evening at 6 p.m., apparently to avoid creating an  hours-long lineup of cars on the dusty entrance road and in the holding lots. Previously, the gates haven’t opened until midnight. And to be official about it, the event itself didn’t actually begin 12:01 a.m., just as advertised.\n\nBut things got to an early start when the cars full of happy faces made their way past the gates and traveled up to the greeters’ stations, where bells were rung to welcome newcomers and people danced and laughed and generally felt pretty damn good about being home again.\n\nHappy to be here? You bet.\n\nEverything felt early this year. The city went up fast, maybe faster than ever. Hell, the Temple is going to open on time this year, and when’s the last time that happened?\n\nTheme camps were let on the playa a bit sooner this year too, the better to set up their situations. And why not? So much work goes into getting it all out here, why not let the camps have a chance of being ready for everyone when the show gets started?\n\nIt’s still going to be fun to watch the progress as the week progresses. The big domes are going up at the sound clubs,  the giant tents are being staked into the ground along the Esplanade, and just as at every DMV everywhere, there were a lot of people waiting for paperwork. You have to have a permit to drive a mutant vehicle on the playa, and that means waiting in line for one. Just like home.\n\nAs you watched the newcomers breaking out their gear, you had to feel good that you didn’t have hours and hours of setup to do. But it was also a little poignant not to be getting the same rush of joy at feeling the desert on your skin again, and being stunned anew by the hugeness of the sky.\n\nThere was lots happening behind the scenes. Between “poofs” from flamethrowers and the thumping of sound systems, the radio was crackling with last-minute details that needed tending to. Art Placement teams were out, making sure that the artists installing their pieces had what they needed and knew the drill. But they all had to break their camps and make the playa a clean landscape for their work.\n\nLogan, the DPW boss, had given his salutary address at the last meeting before the event. In front of the hard-ass group of driven workers, he said, “This is my favorite thing in the world. You’re my favorite people, this is my favorite place, and someday they’re going to look back on this and say, “I can’t believe it kept happening.’ ‘’ There were cheers and applause, and the crews might have stuck out their chests a little further. Twenty years of doing Burning Man in the desert, and it all got done again.\n\nSunday evening down the Gates, Wild Child gathered his crew together to thank them for the work they’d done so far, and to pep them up for the work still to come. There’d be tens of thousands of tickets to check and cars to inspect, and the work would be done around the clock.\n\nThe cauldrons at the Temple were lit at 9, and final preparations were going on out at the Man as the clocked ticked toward midnight. The Man and base looked positively gorgeous, but the light towers still had to move.\n\nAnd even though the doors to the party did open early, there was no way the DPW wasn’t going to party at the gates at midnight. The DPW folks brought their bullhorns and said hello to the arriving guests in their own very special way. And of course they were more than happy to help the Gate crew drink all that beer.\n\nIt was a cold night, but the lights were blazing and the music was blaring at the Cafe. There was a man down at the Carbeque in Gigsville (not too serious, but a little scary), and in the middle of all the madness, there was a wedding at the Pagoda.\n\nSo, welcome to the show. It’ll be moving in a million directions at once. This is the week you’ve been waiting for, and it starts now. There have been hundreds of people getting it ready for you, but there’s no party till you get here. As Sean said the other day, it’s you who bring the awesome.",
