  "content": "As the GLC progressed last weekend, I noticed a theme running through the sessions I was attending and the keynotes: transparency. Transparency in decision making, transparency in finance, transparency in crisis, transparency with officials, etc.\n\nOur leaders are advocating transparency because it reduces Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, a.k.a. FUD. Keeping things secret allows for FUD to spread and we all know how our community loves a little drama.\n\nBut transparency is also scary. What will your critics do when you hand them all your knowledge? But that is not what you should be scared of. Instead consider what your colleagues are unable to do because they are unaware of your knowledge.\n\nAt my day job we have been using the term “working out loud” for some time to describe our commitment to transparency and a quick web search will reveal speakers, books, TED talks, etc. on this topic. In essence “working out loud” is sharing everything you are working on. Now this sharing may not be entirely public, but solo work and knowledge hoarding is quickly becoming a Bad Thing even though it can be a difficult cultural adjustment. Working out loud (WOL) starts with three questions:\n\nAnd it requires three commitments from you\n\nAnd since everything we do has to be radical, I ask you to throw yourself into being transparent in all aspects of your life. Let’s call it an experiment and take about at GLC 2017.\n\nTop photo by Chuck Revell",
