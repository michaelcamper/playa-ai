  "content": "In 1998 I attended my first Burning Man.\nFor the next 5 years or so, I spent 11 months a year waiting, less-than-patiently, for the Burn.\nGradually I started to integrate Burning Man principles into my life and find pockets of Burning Man culture.\n\nNow it feels like I am constantly preparing for (or cleaning up from) Burning Man-inspired brunches, festivals, or days at the beach.\n\nIn fact, last weekend I attended a festival deep in Baja Mexico called “Fuente Eterno.” (See video below) Now, it sells out in 5 minutes, so I am hesitant to hype it up. The odds are you will probably not be able to attend. But the point is there are LOTS of smaller events, regionals, and opportunities to gather with people who have been inspired by Radical Self Expression, Gifting, and the Burning Man Vibe.\n\nDon’t know of one near you? Create it. Participants-only, baby.\n\nI spoke with someone recently who said that after 3 years they, “had gotten all they could from Burning Man.” Sadly, they had failed to get the most important thing of all: It is about the GIVING not the GETTING. I return every year not to get my mind blown by the new Temple design (although that does happen each year), but because I want to enhance the experience for others. It is through Gifting to others’ lives, weeks, or moments that I receive more than I could ever “get” for myself.\n\nThanks to the growing number of large and small events worldwide, that process of gifting and receiving can go on year-round. There is a whole section of the Burning Man website for the Regional Network. Events large and small are growing (and being created) all over the world! Find one. Participate in one. Create one.\n\nMore and more people are seeing Burning Man – not as an event – but as a model for how to live: A model for how to interact with neighbors. A model for how to express yourself & encourage expression in others. And a model for how to Gift your talents to friends, your community, and the world.\n\nDo you attend any large or small “Burner” gatherings? Please share your experiences in the comments!\n\nLove,\nHalcyon )'(\n\n(Video reflection from last weekend’s Fuente Eterno in Baja Mexico.)",
