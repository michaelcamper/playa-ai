  "content": "It’s that time again you artsy weirdos: This is the official call-out for designs for 2016 Burning Man stickers! That’s right, it’s the annual chance to have your art given out to EVERY SINGLE BURNER as they come through the Greeters Station and into Black Rock City. And from that point, those crafty Burners will stick ‘em on just about everything. Trust us, we’ve seen them wind up in some pretty unexpected places.\n\nOne sticker design out of those submitted is selected each year as the “not really official” sticker of the year and given to every Burner. A handful of the other designs will also be turned into sticker schwag sprinkled throughout BRC randomly (immediacy! gifting!) and shared with Burners all year round. Help us remember our wonderful home in the desert even when we’re away!\n\nWhichever type of sticker tickles your fancy (or maybe you’re very ticklish and want to enter several designs), remember there IS a theme, and we like stickers that attempt to use the theme. Read up on the 2016 Art Theme: da Vinci’s Workshop\n\nSo, don’t hesitate. Participate! Thank you and good luck!\n\nDesign Specs:\n\nYour design(s) will need to be one of three die sizes:\n\nYou must OUTLINE all fonts.\n\nIf using 1-3 colors, set up the file to print as PMS. If using 4 or more colors, set up the file to print as CMYK.\n\nDesigner Tips ‘n’ Tricks:\n\nRound stickers are given priority for winning the coveted “Gate Sticker” spot, which goes out to ALL Black Rock Citizens. Other sticker sizes are printed out and handed out to volunteers throughout the year. Including both the name “Burning Man” or “Black Rock City”  and the year 2016 in your design gets you extra awesome brownie points (and a better chance of your image being used for the Gate Design).\n\nSubmitting Your Art:\n\nSend either a PDF file OR (preferably) the original Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file to stickers@burningman.org. Whether sending your design or questions, please put your first and last name in the subject header as well as the phrase “2016 Sticker Submission.\n\nDeadline:\n\nMonday, May 31. No art can be accepted after this date!\n\nOh, and you guys…  you don’t need to bother submitting any more “Bernie Man” jokes. We get it.",
