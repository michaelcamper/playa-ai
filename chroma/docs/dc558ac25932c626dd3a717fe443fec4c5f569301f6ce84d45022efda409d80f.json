  "content": "In his previous work, leading Existential Psychologist Kirk Schneider has put the experience of “awe” at the center of human psychology. Without experiencing awe, life tends to become flat, mechanical, and unhealthy — a prison to be broken out of, rather than a possibility to grow into.\n\nIn his new book, The Spirituality of Awe:  Challenges to the Robotic Revolution, Schneider points out that awe itself is paradoxical: it generates fear and hope, a sense of grandeur and insignificance, of strength and weakness, the imminent and the transcendent … not one right after the other, but all at once. And it is our ability to have these simultaneous experiences, these experiential paradoxes that cannot be resolved rationally, and be present to them, and integrate them into our lives, that is the essence of our humanity.\n\nHe also writes that the danger we face is that new automation technologies, artificial intelligence, and new brain advances are all being designed to eliminate the paradox from our lives. As a result “High tech fulfills many needs, most of them physical, informational, and commercial. What it tends not to fulfill are ‘existential needs’ — purpose, connection, awe for life.”\n\nAs a result, Schneider renews Thomas Mann’s call for a new humanism:\n\nWe talk with Dr. Kirk Schneider about the paradox of human nature and how to find purpose in a high-tech society, in this podcast of the Burning Man Philosophical Center.\n\nCover Photo by Juan P.
