Let’s take a closer look, and learn more about what Burners are up to in our host cities.\n\nHelsinki, Finland\n\nThe Finnish Burner community emerged out of Aalto, a pioneering interdisciplinary university based in Helsinki. This dynamic community has developed through the dedicated efforts of our Regional Contact Anssi Laurila, community leader Jukka-Pekka Heikkilä, and a group of capable and kind Burners affiliated with the school.\n\nSince 2015, the Finns have been bringing ambitious art projects to Burning Man and to other Regional Events and communities. Their projects have included: The Pike of Mana (2015); Koulu School (one of the 26 interactive environments in the guild space of the 2016 Man piazza), which they then took to a post disaster zone in Nepal and a refugee camp in Jordan; “The Cosmic Egg” (2017) that integrated Space on Fire;  and, most recently, Steam of Life (2019), which was a sauna in the middle of the Black Rock Desert.\n\nThe Finns aren’t afraid to try new things, involve new people, and to tackle the hard lessons as part of the process. “I’ve allowed myself to fail,” Jukka-Pekka says. “Nothing ever goes as planned with these projects and that is the beauty of it, perhaps even the magic of it.”\n\nMany faculty members at Aalto and grantors in Finland have supported their forward-thinking initiatives and approaches to community-building.\n\n“We got to use Aalto’s Design Factory to build our first two Burning Man projects,” says Finland Regional Contact Anssi Laurila. “We were able to use the student union as a legal entity to apply for grants and received funding our first year from a foundation that awards grants for Aalto student projects. We were able to have the projects [bound for Black Rock City] labeled as projects from Aalto University, which lent a lot of legitimacy to what were were doing back in 2015.”\n\nFor the past two years, Jukka-Pekka has also been leading an art-driven research project called “Burning Stories.”\n\n“We study individual transformation and its impact on society,” he says. “The ELS Pre-Summit at Aalto will be a great opportunity for our group to share some of our participatory culture research results.”\n\nHelsinki will host the ELS’s two-day academic pre-conference.\n\nDay one, March 31, will take place at Aalto University. This day will focus on Participatory Cultures and Capitalism, and sessions will explore some of the biggest challenges of our time and explore actionable solutions for bridging social and environmental sustainability. A series of short “Lightning Talks” will serve to inspire individuals and organizations to adopt purpose-driven, self-organising and decentralized leadership as operational models that aim to create a more sustainable future.\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nDay two, April 1, will take place in the city of Helsinki (venue TBD). It will explore Participatory Cities and will bring together urban and cultural leaders to co-create solutions for participatory, inclusive, and expressive urban environments. The aim of day two is to better understand the challenges our cities face, from gentrification, rising rents, reduced social space, and cities losing their uniqueness.\n\nTallinn, Estonia\n\nOver the past two years, the Tallinn community has been positively flourishing. They created their very own art car, the Traveling Hedgehog or “Siil” in Estonian, and shipped it to the States for its grand Black Rock City 2019 debut. The Siil appeared in Tallinn last December, where it caught the attention not only of their neighbors, but also of the media. We really can’t wait to show it off to our ELS participants!\n\n“Our Burner community is very active and strong,” says Estonia Regional Contact Ivo Upan. “We share the same values, care for each other, and want to make this world a better place. With this creative and enthusiastic community, we aim to make a strong and positive impact in Estonia and beyond. For that, we are engaged in art projects, civic activation, our permanent space and different events.”\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nThe Estonian Burners also set up their own Creative Space, a community-run hub where they host events, build their artistic projects, and where we’ll host a social gathering during the ELS.\n\nWhen one experiences Tallinn as a city, it’s easy to see how the local Burner community has thrived amid its culture, warm wonderful citizens, and creative vitality. Estonia has been a frontrunner on the world’s tech stage since launching e-residency in 2014 and enticing many innovators across the world to create a homebase in Tallinn, mainly in Telliskivi Creative City where we will hold many of the ELS sessions.\n\nFormerly a railway station-turned industrial complex during the Soviet era, Telliskivi is now a vital hub for startups, art groups, creative communities, and NGOs. We’ll offer our participants the opportunity to experience a range of venues, including Vaba Lava, Lift99, and Club of Different Rooms.\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nThe “Old Town” of Tallinn borders on Telliskivi, and is a world of its own, with winding streets, colorful building facades, tiny shops, and ornate homes. We’ll host some of our programming in a building dating back to the 14th century, which served as a clubhouse for ship owners, merchants, and foreigners, replete with a beer hall, a dark speakeasy-style theater and grand halls where present-day symphonies and various artistic groups perform.\n\nOn Saturday of the ELS, we will bring participants to the site of Bling, a festival run by our local Burning Man community members and other creative spirits. This journey into nature is, for the local Burners, integral to the experience we will create in light of our theme “Human Being: Being Human.”\n\nTallinn Old Town (Photo CCO Public Domain)",
