  "content": "Earlier this week, I was made aware of a “hip new clothing line” that debuted at this year’s Paris Fashion Week. The collection features representations of at least 26 Black Rock City works of art and six mutant vehicles. Several pieces also include derivatives of the Burning Man symbol.\n\nAs I clicked through the photos, my heart began to race. How did this happen? Did the artists give permission? How could ANYONE think this is okay? I was particularly bothered by the use of what appear to be personal messages from participants written on the Temple. Oh, that and the Hug Deli. I mean…. The Hug Deli?! Come on!\n\nBurning Man Project did not authorize and does not condone this use of artwork from the event. Art created for Black Rock City isn’t fodder for ad campaigns or fashion designers.\n\nI’m definitely not the only one who had a strong reaction. Hundreds of community members have expressed outrage; our friend Halcyon hosted two Facebook Live conversations (check them out here and here) and there’s a lively discussion on Reddit.\n\nA number of us here at the organization are working hard to investigate the situation. We are:\n\nWe take the exploitation of Burning Man culture very seriously. We do our best to protect and advocate for those who gift their creativity to our community.\n\nBut there’s only so much that we can do alone. From a legal perspective, Burning Man Project has the right to prevent others from using things like the Man symbol and Burning Man name, but artists own their art (of course). Artists control copyrights to their works, which means they are the ones with the right to license or deny the creation of any reproductions or derivative works.\n\nAnd if there’s one thing we can count on about Burners, it’s that we’re not all going to respond to any situation in the same way. So far we’ve learned the following:\n\nFor the record, Burning Man Project is totally not okay with this use of the Man symbol.\n\nEarlier today, we sent a letter to Manish detailing our concerns and requesting the immediate removal of any pieces from the collection that incorporate any derivative of the Man or Man base, and any other pieces that incorporate the artwork of others without their permission.\n\nThis isn’t someone from the outside world exploiting Burning Man. This is an experienced Burner whose work was included in the No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man exhibition in Washington, D.C., and who seemingly failed to recognize why using these Burning Man community traditions, artworks, and mutant vehicles in his collection is wrong.\n\nIf there’s a silver lining in all of this (and I’m determined to find one!), it’s that this situation has encouraged people to talk at a deeper level about the commodification and exploitation of the Burning Man community. We’re talking about what it feels like when someone takes something central, and even sacred, to a community and uses it for what appears to be commercial gain. We’re talking about why Decommodification is core to who we are and why we find so much meaning and unconditional value in Burning Man events.\n\nAn incident like this, while deeply upsetting, provokes important conversation, and provides an opportunity to acculturate others.\n\nWe don’t have anything against people being inspired by Burning Man. In fact, we created a nonprofit organization specifically to support people bringing the spirit and ethos of Burning Man out of Black Rock City and into the wider world. But being “inspired by” is one thing. Taking the creations of others, without their permission, and suggesting they are your own without giving credit, will not be tolerated.\n\nThat’s not okay with me as a member of this community. And it’s not okay with us as an organization.\n\nIf your artwork or mutant vehicle was used in this collection, please contact us at doingitwrong@burningman.org with any info about your interactions with the designer. Thank you for standing up for the culture we love.\n\nBurning Man culture is not for sale.\n\nArtworks and mutant vehicles represented in the collection:\n\nTop photo by Steven Fritz",
