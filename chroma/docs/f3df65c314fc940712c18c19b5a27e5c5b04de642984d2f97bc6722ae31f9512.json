  "content": "Burner Express Air flights are on sale now, and there’s some new info for 2017, so read on!\n\nBurner Express Air offers transportation between Reno, the Bay Area and Southern California to Black Rock City with flights from Wednesday, August 23 through Monday, September 4.\n\nYou must have a valid Burning Man ticket, Will Call confirmation number, or other valid entry credential to fly into BRC. A Burner Express Air booking alone will not allow you to enter Black Rock City.\n\nWork Access Pass (formerly known as Early Arrival pass) for early arrivals (except Aug. 26!)\n\nIf you fly Burner Express Air before August 26, you must have a Work Access Pass issued to you by your Theme Camp or other provider, or you will not be admitted to Black Rock City. If you’re flying on Saturday, August 26, your Burner Express Air booking allows you early entry —  no WAP is required! (The event doesn’t officially start until 6 pm Sunday, so use the extra time to set up your camp or volunteer).\n\nLuggage\n\nLuggage is limited to the weight and size restrictions of the aircraft, as well as FAA regulations. One piece of luggage is included at no extra charge. Each passenger is allowed his/her own weight plus one piece of luggage not to exceed 25 pounds. That baggage cannot exceed the size of a commercial airline carry-on with the maximum dimensions of 24 inches x 14 inches x 9 inches. Soft-sided and/or duffel bags are strongly recommended.\n\nNew for 2017: More Bags From Reno!\n\nParticipants may book up to five pieces of luggage to and from Reno between Saturday August 26 and Monday September 4. Need more than that? Contact Burner Express Air for cargo.\n\nGetting to and From the BRC Municipal Airport\n\nBurning Man will be operating a shuttle service during the event with pickups every 20 to 45 minutes. These shuttles will connect passengers to routes out to the 9 o’clock and 3 o’clock sides of the city. The shuttle will not make stops at specific camps or deviate from the route, so you may have to carry your luggage the rest of the way to your camp. Alternatively, you can arrange to be picked up at the airport by a licensed Mutant Vehicle and taken directly to your camp.\n\nRegular passenger vehicles or vehicles that do not have BRC driving permits will not be allowed to pick up or drop off passengers at the airport. They will be turned away.\n\nPurchase Water in Advance\n\nBurner Express Air passengers can purchase water in advance and fill up on the playa. You must bring your own container (we recommend collapsible five-gallon containers so they fit in your luggage). Water must be filled upon arrival in BRC and is only available to Burner Express riders. The cost is $1.50 per gallon. You must purchase water in advance. There will be no on-site sales.\n\nCamping\n\nIf you’re not part of a placed camp, you may only camp between G Street and L Street outside of the blue flags. Blue flags in the ground mark off reserved camping; do not camp within blue flags.\n\nYou are not allowed to reserve camping space for people who have not arrived yet. If you are found holding space, someone from the Placement Team will move your belongings and remove any markers or boundaries you have set up.\n\nIf you are interested in camping or volunteering at the Airport or for the Burner Express Air program, please fill out this form.\n\nPro tips:\n\nBurning Man Is Better When You Get Involved\n\nRemember, flying in to BRC is just the start! Burning Man takes place in a remote and unforgiving environment. It is your responsibility to prepare yourself, and to bring everything you need to survive and thrive. Get your Radical Self-reliance on. If you’re buying tickets for someone else, make sure all ticket holders read the Survival Guide and watch these videos.\n\nBurning Man is a culture of doing, and there are countless ways to get involved. Everything out there is a work of Radical Self-expression and Communal Effort. Black Rock City would not be possible without the contributions of thousands of volunteers.
