  "content": "This year I perceive a sad, mournful thread\nOld-timers proclaim: “Burning Man’s dead!”\nToo many people, too many cars\nToo many rules and too many scars.\n\nThe notion of “radical self-expression”\nHas suffered corrosion by massive suppression\nOnce hailed an escape from the world we’d depart\nSeems burdened by mischief and vandals of art.\n\nHow can our Burning Man stay alive?\n“Leave No Trace” and “Gifting” still thrive?\nWe must dig deep within our souls\nRecall those passionate, creative goals!\n\nThat which we seek when wide-eyed we came\nAs virgins entranced towards this huge burning flame\nStill flickers with hope! Our embers ignite\nRekindled by joy each year we unite.\n\nby Constance Hull",
