We recommend participants wait in Reno or elsewhere for several hours until the congestion is cleared.\n\nFor your own safety, if you’re stopped on Highway 447, please remain in your vehicle. And do not park on the shoulder of Interstate 80 — find an off ramp and park on a side road.\n\nWe will update this message with new information as soon as it becomes available.\n\nYou can also hear updates by tuning in to BMIR or by following @bmantraffic on Twitter.\n\n[UPDATE: 8/31/15 2:00am]\n\nAt this time, the drive from Wadsworth to Gerlach is taking about 5 1/2 hours.
