  "content": "Last night I watched the Mazu Temple burn, a glorious shower of fireworks followed by a beautiful flower of fire that left a steel column holding a lotus blossom behind.\n\nThis morning, I saw the DPW finally – after a week of delays – use their trebuchet to launch a flaming piano into the air.\n\nThen, on my way back to camp, I saw a grown man with a young girl who was holding a basket full of candy.\n\n“Ice cold M&M’s!” the man called out.  “Get your chilled M&M’s!  All you have to do is take candy from a strange child!  Go ahead!  Take candy from a strange child!  It’s all right!  You can do it!”\n\nWho says kids have no place at Burning Man?\n\nI thought you would want to know.",
