  "content": "Exciting news! Today the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signed a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), issued a decision record on our Environmental Assessment (EA), granted us a Special Recreation Permit for 2012, and announced a maximum population for the 2012 event of approximately 60,900 participants!\n\nCheck out our press release.\n\nRead BLM’S letter announcing their decision.\n\nJoin us today in celebrating: we have a permit for this year’s event and approval to expand our population!  We know this will have many readers asking if this means there will be additional tickets for this year.\n\nNow that we have our permit, we have an accurate number to work from when discussing the best approach in the coming weeks.\n\nWe had previously been working with a projected population of 58,000 and now we know that we can have a peak population of 60,900 in Black Rock City.\n\nThe Directed Ticket Distribution process is still underway.  For more information about how any additional tickets made available by the new population cap will be distributed to Burners looking for tickets, keep your eyes on the Jackrabbit Speaks Newsletter!\n\nCopies of the Final EA, Finding of No Significant Impact, Decision Record, SRP Decision and related documents are available for viewing and upon request from the BLM Winnemucca District Office and online here.",
