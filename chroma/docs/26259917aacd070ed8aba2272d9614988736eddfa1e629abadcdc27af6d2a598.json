Perhaps you were one of thousands of Burners to fill out our random sampling form on playa (we randomly sample vehicles, buses, and planes entering the event to improve the accuracy of the data we collect). Perhaps you were one of 9,168 phenomenal people who participated after the Burn by completing the online survey. Perhaps you visited us at Census Lab in Center Camp. Regardless, we hope you already know what we do and why we do it (this article will give you some background) and are as excited as we are to see our 2017 Census data.\n\nHere are the links:\n\nMy experience of Burning Man 2017 lasted four months and changed my life. How many other attendees are forever changed by this event we all help to create? We have researchers who ask questions about just that.\n\nIn June 2017, I attended a volunteer weekend to help build the structure in the middle of the event, the Man Base. I spent the weekend working with an incredibly impressive team of builders, learned new skills (carpentry), and went home with sore muscles and a new outlook on life. During the six hour drive back to Oregon, I thought about my IT desk job and realized I’d rather be building. I quit my job and was gainfully “funemployed” by July. My first day of funemployment I drove back to Reno and officially started volunteering for DPW (Burning Man’s Department of Public Works) for the season, and learning to be a builder. Building is now my full-time job, and I’m back with DPW for the 2018 season.\n\nDid you know that more than half of Burners in 2017 (56.2%) were inspired to learn or practice creating art after attending? See Figure 1, below. Figure 2 shows that the majority of people who were inspired to learn find those skills useful in their everyday lives.\n\nFor me, participation is a big part of what Burning Man is about. It is, after all, one of the Ten Principles written by Larry Harvey, founder of Burning Man. These principles outline the ethos of all Burning Man-related events (including Regional Events).\n\nGretchen, a 2017 virgin Burner and BRC Census volunteer says:\n\nBRC Census has teams of statisticians and researchers who aim to look at experiences like mine and Gretchen’s (and all of yours!) on a broader scale. Current questions we aim to answer are:\n\nIf we fast-forward to September, online survey respondents will find new and exciting research topics in addition to these. We’ve been joined by researchers asking new questions, such as:\n\nWe hope you enjoy the 2017 data. If you find this stuff interesting, consider volunteering with us, either on playa or even during the rest of the year. We love hearing new ideas and interested minds.\n\nWritten by “Chipper” McKay\nEdited by Dana “DV8” DeVaul, Sarah “Picky” Williamson, and Abigail “Tinker” Doyle\n\nTop image: Man Base during construction, one week before the event opens, 2017 (Photo by Dustin DeRyke)",
