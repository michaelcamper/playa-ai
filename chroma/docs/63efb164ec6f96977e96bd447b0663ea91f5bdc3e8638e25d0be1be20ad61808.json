  "content": "Burning Man co-founders Larry Harvey and Michael Mikel (aka Danger Ranger) join “This is Burning Man” author Brian Doherty for an evening exploring the past, present and future of Burning Man, July 24 at Z Space Theater in San Francisco.\n\nBurning Man started with a handful of people on Baker Beach, and over 27 years has grown to become a cultural phenomenon that attracts 60,000 participants to the Nevada Desert each summer. Now organizers are expanding beyond the desert to ignite a cultural, technological and artistic evolution on a global scale.\n\nTicket sales benefit the nonprofit Burning Man Project, dedicated to extending Burning Man culture into the world. Pricing is “pay what you can” to benefit the Project: $20, $30 or $50. Premium seating at $125 includes “This is Burning Man” hard cover book signed by the presenters. $100 of this is tax deductible.\n\nZ Space Theater is at 450 Florida Street in San Francisco. Doors open at 6 p.m. and the presentation begins at 7 p.m. A reception and book signing will take place immediately following the discussion.\n\nFor more information and to reserve tickets, click here.\n\nFor more about the Burning Man Project: burningmanproject.org",
