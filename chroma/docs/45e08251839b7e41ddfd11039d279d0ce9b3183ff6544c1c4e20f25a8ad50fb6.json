  "content": "Hello out there all you MOOP maniacs and line sweepers extraordinaire. We’re back with the penultimate installment of MOOP Map Live 2012! Yes, that’s right, another incredible season is drawing to its close, and the last teensy remnants of Black Rock City have been swept away by the amazing Playa Restoration crew.\n\nLet’s give a shout out to that crew now, as we examine the well-dusted machine that is our 115-member Restoration team. This group of highly trained, dedicated and foolhardy individuals join forces to create the ultimate Playa Zamboni, inhaling MOOPy dust and exhaling pure drifted playa.\n\nPhase One of this process belongs to the imposing MOOP Line Sweep, a 75-member force with another 15 acting as support. The Line Sweep marches tirelessly from block to block, capturing every morsel of MOOP it can — all without breaking pace. See video:\n\n… but what about that hot spot? That’s left for Special Forces, a “crack” team of desert-fried investigators whose raison d’etre is the lowly wood chip. Their mission: to remove every last splinter of wood from the playa — along with glitter bombs, grey water spots, and even the “blue playa jewels” left behind when a bank of portapotties disappears.\n\nIt’s a glamorous job, and the Special Forces teams are experienced, talented and absolutely crucial to the Restoration effort. Here they are, doing what they do best:\n\nWow! Way to go Playa Restoration! You kids are funny looking!\n\nAnd now, the results of Day Six of MOOP Map Live. In Day 6, the MOOP Line marched all the way from 2:00 to 10:00 between Begonia and Columbine, leaving only Center Camp un-swept. And here are your results:\n\nMOOP Map Legend:\n\nGREEN: GO! GO! GO! The Line Sweep moves quickly because it’s clean. Minimal time and effort spent in this location.\nYELLOW: Caution! The Line Sweep moves at a stop-and-go pace. Moderate time and effort spent in this location.\nRED: Full stop. The Line Sweepers are on their hands and knees. A ton of MOOP. Extensive time and effort in this location.\n\nNicely done, you B-and-C’ers! Your streets were mostly green, and your red spots were nice and small! Just the way we like ’em. A clear victory — with only a little room to improve — for these bombin’ blocks.\n\nThere’s just one spot left to MOOP: Center Camp, and we’ll return to it real soon. For now, this is The Hun signing off.\n\nToday, all your photos and videos were created by The Hun, excepting the MOOP Meter which is by Ballyhoo Betty!",
