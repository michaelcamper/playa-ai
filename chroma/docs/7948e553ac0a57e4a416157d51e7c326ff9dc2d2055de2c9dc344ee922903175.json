  "content": "Sunday night, after dark, I’m walking down 4 o’clock towards the Esplanade.  Deep in unpleasant thoughts, lost in my head already, as I sometimes get at Burning Man.\n\nFrom the opposite direction, a young woman rides her bike towards me.  I can barely see her in the glare of her headlights.\n\nAs we pass each other she calls out “You know you’re going the wrong direction!”\n\nI try to see her, but darkness and light are all I get.  “Which direction should I be going?” I call back.\n\n“All of them!” she shouts, without a moment’s hesitation, and then is gone.",
