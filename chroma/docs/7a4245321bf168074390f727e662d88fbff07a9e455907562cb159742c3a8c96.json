  "content": "After many years of beautiful work, Lisa Hoffman, Burning Man’s volunteer BRC Map designer, is stepping down. This development allows for a new artist to show their skills, and offers an opportunity to rethink the traditional design. This role calls for nothing less than an infographics genius with attention to detail bordering on the obsessive, and someone who can demonstrate considerable talent and experience in illustration, design and print production.\n\nLisa’s Wisdom for New City Map Designers\n\nThe BRC Map has been amazingly intricate and diverse over the years. How did Lisa even do it? “Each year I tried to create something different,” Lisa says. “I always think it’s great when people are surprised that it has been the same person designing the BRC Map and Guide since 2001.”\n\nFor starters, she had major Burner experience under her belt. “1991 was my first year at Burning Man,” Lisa says. “I returned every year until 1995 when the City started to feel too big and out of control. That was the year many people I would soon become friends with started to go. By 2000 they had convinced me to come back. In 2001 I began designing the map.”\n\nSo intimate knowledge of Burning Man culture is a prerequisite. What about the creative process? Here’s how Lisa describes it:\n\nA great example of Lisa’s ability to blend excellent infographics with an artistic interpretation of the theme is the 2010 map for Metropolis:\n\nLisa was granted official written permission from Transport for London to use the roundel inspired logo.\n\nUp for the Challenge? Here’s What It Takes\n\nYour vision/interpretation of the 2016 art theme\n\nHere is where your artistry and genius comes in: please read through the full art theme “da Vinci’s Workshop” text before you start designing. Familiarize yourself with past map designs here. A successful BRC map designer is like a chameleon, changing stripes, producing distinctive visuals, exploring and exploiting tangential theories and philosophies, while at all costs avoiding obvious and trite representations of the art theme.\n\nYour portfolio samples should demonstrate essential technical experience and skills\n\nThe map and guide essentials\n\nCollaboration is key\n\nProject Timeline and Deliverables (Firm)\n\nIMPORTANT: If you cannot commit to this production timeline please do not pursue this project/role. Unfortunately there is no room for flexibility here, sorry!\n\nSubmission of Electronic Portfolio Samples\n\nPlease send web links to brcmap@burningman.org by May 15, 2016\n\nHard copy samples by May 15, 2016 to:\n\nBRC Map att’n: Placement\nBurning Man\n660 Alabama Street\n4th Floor\nSan Francisco, CA 94110\n\nInterviews/Samples in San Francisco\n\nIf selected, please be available for interview, with printed samples, between the hours of 10 am and 5 pm M-F.",
