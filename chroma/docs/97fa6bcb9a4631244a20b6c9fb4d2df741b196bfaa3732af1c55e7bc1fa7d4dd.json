  "content": "There’s an amazing amount of new art on the Playa this year, and one of the biggest reasons is the presence of 24 effigies set up by the CORE project, the association of Burning Man Regional groups from around the world.\n\nFor the first time, the Regionals will stage their own burn, on Thursday night, when all 24 of the projects will go up in flames in a giant ring around the Man.\n\nIt’s a sign of the growing significance of the Regionals. As the main Burning Man event continues to push the size limits of the playa, the importance of having Regional events climbs.\n\n“There are many people in the Regionals who’ve never even been to Burning Man,” Action Girl was saying at a gathering in the Center Cafe on Tuesday. “But they still feel a part of the community now.”\n\nThe Regional organizations began 13 years ago,  so you could say that their big burn project this year  could be called their Burn Mitzvah, it was noted at the gathering.\n\nAmong the many effigies on the playa this year are Lucky Lady Lucy, the creation of the Las Vegas group. The funding for the project was grass-roots, as evidenced by the garage sale held by Dr. Gooey to help raise money. The effigy from the South Bay group  is made up of a crossed stairway of laptops rising out of an orchard. Very fitting for the Silicon Valley.\n\nOne of the largest and most ornate effigies is OuroBouros, from the very large and very active Austin group.\n\n“There’s no reason the fire hose of creativity has to be aimed at the desert,” Action Girl said at the meeting. “And the purpose is not just to throw big parties. It’s about civic engagement.”",
