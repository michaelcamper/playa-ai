  "content": "This “adjusted” list of the 10 Principles of Burning Man was written by Melinda Green for the 2012 Boston-area regional, where I understand they were part of an art exhibit.\n\nThey’re funny enough to repeat.  So, with Melinda’s permission, I present (just in time for Burning Man’s Global Leadership Summit):  the 10 Principles – as we really live them.\n\nRemind you of anybody you know?\n\nRadical inclusion\n\nWe want to show you how welcoming and open we are as a community, how much we accept and love everyone. Oh crap. We don’t want all these people here.\n\nGifting\n\nOnly one letter separates gifting from grifting. R you in? Everyone loves getting things from others, so do as little as possible and take as much as you can at all times.\n\nDecommodification\n\nSometimes, all of us want things manufactured and/or sold by corporations who offend our sensibilities. When this happens, just steal. And then remove or conceal any identifiable branding so none of your radically-inclusive friends will know you like new items with brand names.\n\nRadical Self Reliance\n\nPeople bearing hugs or gifts should always be viewed with suspicion. Regardless of what they say, you only have yourself to rely upon.\n\nRadical Self Expression\n\nExpress yourself and your greatest desires. Wear your emotions on your sleeve and grab the world by its balls. But please try to keep this sort of thing under wraps if you’re not particularly attractive.\n\nCommunal Effort\n\nWe value creative & cooperative collaboration. This means you eagerly help while following the orders of those who have been here longer and know better.  It may take a village but a village is nothing without a dozen project managers.\n\nCivic responsibility\n\nWe value civic society. Look around at those next to you. What are they doing? Just do exactly as they do but try to wear a better costume.\n\nLeave No Trace\n\nAlways be aware of your environment.  Do not leave any clues you were once here. The vast majority of your peers do not want to pick up your shit, so prey on the kindhearted to do it whenever you forget.\n\nParticipation\n\nWe achieve through doing and we achieve through play. Everyone’s contribution is key. Participate often and tell everyone how much you participate so they are aware your participation is always the only reason anything happens.\n\nImmediacy\n\nLike now. RIGHT NOW. Not 5 minutes from now. Or even 5 seconds. Why the fuck you still reading? GO DO IT NOW. Whatever it is you have been told to do, GO DO IT NOW.",
