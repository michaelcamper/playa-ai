  "content": "This comes from our intrepid Black Rock City Census team.\n\nThe only thing constant is change …\n\nOver time, the data gathering methods of the Census have progressed from an exclusively paper survey that was distributed on playa and required manual input of responses to the combination of a paper survey, a random sampling of Burners and online surveys. In 2013, the Census team will be gathering data via a random sampling at the Gate during ingress and exodus and a post-event online survey.\n\nThe Census is online …\n\nThe Census will be available online on Tuesday after the Burn (September 3, 2013) at http://census.burningman.com. We would love to receive your responses and welcome your input. The online Census fosters the immediacy principle of Burning Man and enables BRC citizens to access the Census independently of their preferences in terms of Burning Man experiences. It also allows the Census to be more eco-conscious by reducing the need for printed forms. Further, eliminating the paper form means removing the need for data entry and drastically reducing the data errors due to manual entry.\n\nThe random sampling during ingress and exodus …\n\nBecause the data from the online Census is biased toward those people that independently choose to complete the online survey, the random sampling of Burners at the Gate yields data that drastically improve the representativeness, validity and trustworthiness of all the results produced by the Census. The randomness of the cars selected to participate in a paper form of the Census is predetermined. Professional statisticians advise as to the days, times and selection interval for the random sampling.\n\nThe end result …\n\nWe want to hear from you! Census aims to provide the most accurate and thorough data possible. By employing the online Census and random sampling during ingress and exodus, relatively unbiased results about the BRC population can be presented.\n\nPlease visit us at Census Lab located in Center Camp near Media Mecca. You can view all the data collected last year and the Census Burners hope to answer your questions and provide information about the service we provide. There will also be information about the Census in the Greeter packet. We hope you are inclined to participate in the online Census or at the Gate should your car be randomly selected.\n\nHope you have a great Burn!",
