Who would want to do such a thing? Well, I would. Read on to see if you would, too.\n\nWhen I was introduced to the ethos of Burning Man, I was told participation was welcomed and encouraged. Since my first stumble into the dust, I knew: I couldn’t just go to Black Rock City, I needed to build it, to live it, and to support its citizens in all their wild endeavors. Once you’ve commandeered a Spanish galleon, built a Temple for your fallen friends, or tamed a great sea creature, there’s little chance of going back.\n\nOver the years, my addiction grew, and whenever I was threatened with too much down time, I’d wander off to other projects and build sites to offer my hands and help. This happens to some of us out in Black Rock City; we really don’t know how to sit idle, and we love it.\n\nWhen offering help to build crews as they scramble to make their magic happen, you need to read between the lines. When you ask if they need help, and they reply…\n\n“OH DEAR GOD or satan, or somebody, NOW WE NEED TO BURN THIS on NO SLEEP and WHERE’S THE CHAINSAW?! ohmy$*%$goshzzzzzzzzz…….OH NO. WE’RE FINE!”\n\nYou need to translate that to: “Of course I need help, but I am close to the edge and do not even know how to tell you about the help I need!”\n\nThe Artists Need You!\n\nOver the years helping artists with Burn Perimeters, I have formed a very strong opinion.\n\nThe Burn Perimeter for an art piece should never be the responsibility of its creators and builders. They should not have to stand with their backs to the fire waiting to keep bikes and people out of the perimeter. The burn is their celebration, their release, their moment of catharsis and camaraderie and relief.  They should revel in it.\n\nThis story should illustrate why:\n\nIn 2016, my right hand man and fellow burnaholic Andrés and I rolled out to our friends at Black Rock Lighthouse Service and arrived just as the crew had been hit with stressful news. The leader of their Burn Perimeter Team needed to leave the city suddenly and unexpectedly… on the day of their burn. Instinctually I said, “No worries, I got it!” The team leads blinked. “Yep, really! And ah, Andrés will lead it with me.” (Thanks buddy).\n\nAndrés and I met with the leads of the project and the official Burn Perimeter Crew of BRC and explained our willingness to step in and take over for the Lighthouse crew. Word of mouth is a powerful thing out on playa, and participants’ desire to support the art even more\n\nso. That night, despite some fierce whiteouts and the general confusion of last-minute changes, we were overjoyed as more and more volunteers appeared out of the dust.\n\nAfter the burn, the Lighthouse crew showered us with gratitude yet again, and a few of those who had been hesitant to give up control thanked me pointedly. Many participants who had come for the burn thanked and high-fived me and showed their thanks through the looks on their faces.\n\nYou on Board Yet? Join a Burn Perimeter Team!\n\nAfter this experience, it was brought to my attention that some of the great minds of Burning Man would like to organize a more formal Burn Perimeter Support Team, a premeditated collective of volunteers at the ready, to ensure no art project feels the pressure and stress of holding a perimeter with their last ounce of strength again. Naturally I jumped on board and am thrilled to help this come to life.\n\nIf you would like to help with a Burn Perimeter at Burning Man:\n\nBegin by creating a new Burner Profile or logging into your existing one.\n\nThen sign up there to volunteer and tick off the Burn Perimeter Support Team.\n\nOnce we hear from you, an email will be sent in a week or two with more information.\n\nThanks for helping keep the burning in Burning Man.\n\nTop photo: Temple of Grace by David Best (Photo by Zipporah Lomax)",
