  "content": "Since our initial statement about the coronavirus (COVID-19), the situation has been evolving daily. We have been watching, reading and listening as new information and details emerge. Like all of you, we have been striving to understand what this outbreak means for our communities and our families. We are also thinking deeply about the impact on our global network, our nonprofit, and our plans for Black Rock City 2020. We are taking this situation very seriously and taking proactive steps to ensure our staff and community are as safe as possible. Here are some related updates:\n\nOf course, one of the biggest questions is whether we’ll be able to build and experience Black Rock City 2020. In the current climate of uncertainty it is simply too soon to tell. There are some indications that the virus may peak in the next couple of months and then begin to subside, while others believe the pandemic could have a much longer timeline. Some large-scale events are being rescheduled from spring until fall. Black Rock City is still five months away, and a lot can happen between now and then. So much is beyond our powers to predict or control.\n\nWe believe the responsible course is to proceed with caution and not make a premature decision one way or the other. For now, we are going to continue to thoughtfully and mindfully prepare for Black Rock City 2020. We have reached out to our government partners and have been working with state agencies in Nevada. We recently announced our Black Rock City 2020 Honoraria recipients and released our callout for designs for civic plazas near the Man Base. We will continue to consider the facts and make thoughtful, informed decisions about next steps.\n\nMany of you have purchased or are considering purchasing tickets to the 2020 event and are wondering what will happen if we have to cancel. We are exploring every possible option for offering refunds if the coronavirus pandemic ultimately requires cancellation of the 2020 event. Our terms and conditions state that tickets are non-refundable “for any reason,” but we recognize the extremely unusual circumstance we’re all in. Issuing refunds would be challenging for our nonprofit organization, which supports year-round staff and programming, but we are aware of and sensitive to the difficult financial position so many members of our global community are in right now. Like you, we’re feeling our way in the dark here. We are examining all possible scenarios that would enable all of us to weather this storm while continuing to build our home in Black Rock City together, at a later date if not in 2020.\n\nThis is a challenging, uncertain time, but we are rising to the occasion by tapping into the best of what we love about Burning Man. Burners are resilient, creative, and infinitely resourceful. And we’re in this together. Already, we’ve seen people embodying the 10 Principles by coming together virtually, gifting to those in need, sharing precious resources, and devising new ways to create and celebrate as we collectively hunker down. We have faith in the capacity of the global Burning Man community to thrive and provide essential support to those who need it most.\n\nThis is a stark and, yet in some ways, touching reminder that Burning Man is not just a week in the desert. Burning Man is a year-round, global community made up of the most innovative thinkers, doers, dreamers, and makers. This new challenge requires us to work together to solve formidable problems. Burners are good at that.\n\nWe can also all play a role in reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Now is the time to champion our community’s Principles, especially Civic Responsibility and Communal Effort. Please do your part by taking every possible precaution. Wash your hands (again!). Read the U.S. CDC’s guidelines and the World Health Organization’s page for info on how to take care of yourself and others. Depending on where in the world you live, your government may be leading the way proactively. For others, maybe not. Either way, you can step up and set a positive example. This is a collective action that requires individual participation from all of us. Thank you for doing your part.\n\nWe will share additional updates as new information becomes available.
