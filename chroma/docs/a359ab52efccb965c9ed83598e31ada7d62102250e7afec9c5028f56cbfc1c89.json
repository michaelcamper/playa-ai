  "content": "By popular demand, we are pleased to announce the resurrection of the Burning Man Ticket Pre-sale, in advance of the holidays, for Burning Man 2009!\n\nFor years we’ve heard feedback from enthusiastic early-planner types who’d like to be able to gift Burning Man tickets to friends and loved ones at the holidays instead of waiting until January. As always, this year’s ticket will illustrate our art theme – Evolution – and we deem it particularly beautiful; a perfect gift. Other participants aren’t so concerned about holding out for the lower-priced tickets available on launch day, and would rather get a ticket now, and thus avoid the rush.\n\nIn answer, we give you the Holiday Ticket Pre-sale. Here’s how it will work: we’ll offer 1,000 tickets at $260 each (this will be the third tier ticket price for ’09; more details on the full ticket launch will be posted on our web site on December 12). These tickets will be a special allotment and the quantity will NOT come out of any of the pricing tiers for our regular ticket launch on January 14. (And no, it won’t affect your chances to try for any of the first or second tier tickets when they’re available.)\n\nPre-sale tickets will be available online beginning Friday, 11/14 at 10:00am PST.\n\nTickets will stay on sale until 11:59pm PST December 28 OR the allotment of 1000 presale tickets run out, whichever comes first.\n\nFor all the nitty gritty details, please visit tickets.burningman.com.
