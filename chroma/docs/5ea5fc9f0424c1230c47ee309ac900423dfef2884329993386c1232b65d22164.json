  "content": "Yeah, Decompression is real.\n\nBut don’t stew in upset at how the Default World is not like Black Rock City.\nInstead, STEP UP and be the person you are in BRC in the Default World.\n\nIt will be harder.  You will have less support.\nBut you owe it to the planet.\n\nYou got a golden ticket and got to witness the best of humanity.\n\nNow you are an ambassador.\n\nYou have the responsibility to role-model your best to the world.\n\nPractice the Principles. Shine bright, gift big, and live radically.\n\nGive others permission to do the same. Create ripples of inspiration.\n\nThis is how we change the world.\n\nTop photo by Craig “Kiwi” Brayton",
