  "content": "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Rod Garrett, the long-time architect and designer of Black Rock City.\n\nSince 1997, Rod has guided the Black Rock City urban design, overseeing its evolution from a functional plan to provide structure to a desert encampment of 10,000 to supporting a thriving metropolis of 50,000+, always with an eye towards form, function, elegance and the development of community. In addition to his urban planning role, Rod also designed Black Rock City’s major infrastructural elements, including the Center Camp Café, and every Man base since 1997.\n\nThrough his work over the years, Rod has made considerable contributions to the Burning Man community, for Rod’s particular genius was understanding the importance and power of design as it relates to social interaction and cultural development. Rod’s brilliance, passion and dedication to his craft will be sorely missed by the Burning Man organization.\n\nMany of Rod’s writings about designing Black Rock City can be found in the Metropol Blog Series.\n\nThis year, the road encircling Black Rock City’s Center Camp will be named “Rod’s Road” in his honor.",
