  "content": "Burn long enough and it will happen: you’ll fall in love out there.\n\nBut once we return to the land of hot showers, plain clothing, and real responsibilities, can playa love last?\n\nFalling in love at the Burn can leave you with a spinning head, a soaring heart, some serious emotional whiplash, or…unwelcome burning sensations. Whatever the outcome, these stories of playa love all try to answer the same question:\n\nWhat just happened here?\n\nIn their luminous transcendence and flaming destruction, they’re not always easy tales to tell. But we try anyway: like Burning Man itself, these experiences melt us down and reshape us. They transform us from who we were into who we are.\n\nBurning Love is a new podcast exploring what happens when love lights up the playa and we try to bring love home from Home.\n\nIf you’d like to submit a story for consideration, come find me in the dust this year at Milk + Honey at 6:45 and C. Ask for Lotus. Or, send the highlight reel to burninglovetheshow@gmail.com.\n\nFor now, pair the portable speaker, pop the earbuds, or power on the stereo.\n\nAnd enjoy the blaze.\n\nMeet Tony and Daniel Wichowski, also known as Mr. Pepperdine and Scratch.\n\nTony and Daniel met on playa in 2014 and married there legally in 2015. They remain unmistakably in love today.\n\nBut happily ever after endings don’t write themselves. Sometimes, it takes a transcontinental sacrifice, commitment to the sport of extreme paperwork filing, and a Supreme Court case to pull one off. Swiss cigarettes help.\n\nYou can find Burning Love on iTunes , Stitcher, Google Play Music, or, as they like to say, wherever you get your podcasts.",
