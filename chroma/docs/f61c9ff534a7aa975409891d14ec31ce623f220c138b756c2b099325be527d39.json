  "content": "The Man got put in his place late in the afternoon Wednesday, and it was a sight.\n\nBig Stick maneuvered the machinery into place, the Man crew performed their rituals, an admiring throng gathered, and up he went.\n\nThe Man started out the afternoon flat on his back, where a lot of us would like to be. By the end of the operation, he was standing atop the Metropolis base, looking out over Black Rock City. Also where a lot of us would like to be.\n\nHe was very shiny in the afternoon sun. The Man has a silvery sheen this year, and Will Chase was saying that maybe we should spread a rumor that he was made of metal and wouldn’t burn. But don’t worry; he’s made of wood, as usual, and oh, he’ll burn.",
