  "content": "The topic keeps coming up, so I spent a few minutes talking about what I perceive as the main differences between “festivals” and “Burning Man.”\n\nFESTIVAL: Organizers curate lineup & entertainment.\n\nBURNING MAN: Organizers establish Framework only.\n\nFESTIVAL: Ticket bought in exchange for entertainment. (Transactional)\n\nBURNING MAN: Ticket bought to contribute your share of the city infrastructure costs. (Participatory)\n\nFESTIVAL: Attendees are either Entertainers, Staff, or Audience\n\nBURNING MAN: Every participant is Host, Medic, Janitor, Tour Guide, Audience and Entertainer.\n\nFESTIVAL: Physical division between stages & RV and camping area.\nBURNING MAN: No “Stages” area vs. “Camping” Area\n\nAgree? Disagree? Other distinctions I missed?\n\nUPDATE: Grey Beard correctly pointed out that this is just the tip of the sand dune.  Study up on the 10 Principles, like “Gifting,” to see the deep differences.",
