Done well, the work you experience there will push you into new and unexpected discomfort zones.\n\nManaging your waste stream in Black Rock City is a daily practice. Think about taking a holistic approach — get the big picture with this checklist, then focus on the details day by day. By planning ahead and communicating your LNT system to your campers, you can avoid a dusty, messy, MOOPy shitshow when it’s time to leave the Black Rock Desert and go home.\n\nThere are some great tools out there to help you take your LNT game to the next level. Our favorite is the Black Rock Sauna Society Camp (BRSS)’s Camp Waste Management User Guide, which they’ve made available to one and all. It gives you very practical tips on how to set up your recycling tent and LNT shifts and offers valuable tips on how to minimize landfill waste and LNT costs. Download it and share it with your crew.\n\nTo help you organize and implement your LNT practice, we’ve created a high-level checklist, which follows a start-to-finish trajectory that can be followed by any camp or project.\n\nStep 1: Planning\n\nHow can your camp get off fossil fuels? Take a moment to calculate your camp or project’s carbon footprint and think about how you can offset your impact.\n\nThen, learn about carbon-free practices from:\n\nStep 2: Staging\n\nThink about future you, the one who wishes to struggle less on the flipside of your Black Rock City adventure. There are some super simple things you can do while you shop and stage for your BRC adventure to streamline your waste stream and minimize your impact.\n\nStep 3: Arrival\n\nAs soon as you arrive at your camp location:\n\nStep 4: Burn Week\n\nRemember that LNT lead you volun-told? Every morning, they’ll check your camp’s LNT system. Is recycling spilling into the compost spilling into the greywater (we sure hope not… but it happens)? Entrust your LNT lead to educate errant campmates over and over and over again, if necessary.\n\nEveryone in your camp should:\n\nStep 5: Strike\n\nIf you made it all the way to this section, you’ll understand why thinking ahead is the REAL playa magic. Here are essential steps for Leaving No Trace when you take down your camp and prepare to leave.\n\nStep 6: Departure\n\nIt feels SO good, getting out knowing that you left the playa neat and tidy.\n\nStep 7: Exodus\n\nIn the Exodus lineup, peep at the load on your vehicle; make sure it’s secure. While you’re at it, be a nosy LNT busybody and help friends and strangers whose loads are… disorganized.\n\nOnly leave your trash, recycling and greywater at authorized disposal sites. Here is a list of locations in surrounding communities that are ready and willing to take your waste off your hands. Pretty please do not leave your trash in the surrounding small towns or behind businesses in Reno or elsewhere.\n\nDid we tell you that we love you? We do. And the playa loves you too, because you made it to the end of this oh-so-helpful leave no trace article. We’d give you a prize, but you already know that the real prize is a drama- and MOOP-free Exodus. (And an ‘all-clear’ on the MOOP Map.) No sticker or patch could ever bring the same amount of satisfaction.\n\nLeaving No Trace in Black Rock City is YOUR responsibility, as creators and citizens of our dusty metropolis. Ensuring the Black Rock Desert returns to a pristine condition post event requires the Communal effort of each and every citizen — not just at the end of the event, but before and during.\n\nSo there’s your lecture and pep talk. Let’s show the world (and ourselves) what Burners are capable of!",
