  "content": "The days are getting warmer, tickets are showing up in the mail and the trolls are spreading mistruths online.  Yes, it is that time of year again:Pre-Burn Season!\n\nThis is also the time of year that first timers start to ask for advice from their veteran Burner friends.  I first send them to the fantastic survival guide, then to my tips & tricks videos (starting with the ones for Virgins).  Then I pat their head, tell them it is all going to be okay, and share some version of the message below.  In addition to bringing the right gear, it is important to bring the right attitude.\n\n*This video was requested from participants of this year’s Midburn. It is worded in a way that applies to people heading to any event where Radical Self Expression and Gifting is embraced.\n\n**If, after watching, you don’t feel drawn to attend this year, please sell your ticket back through official channels. There are many eager and well deserving people waiting for your ticket in the STEP program.",
