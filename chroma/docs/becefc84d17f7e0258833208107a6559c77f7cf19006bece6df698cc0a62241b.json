The Hun here, checking in after a very R-E-A-L weekend.\n\nBoy, did it rain in the desert.\n\nThursday brought a deluge, and by Friday the playa was limned with glinting streams – standing water just waiting to swallow vehicles and turn your feet into mudboots. And then … it rained again.\n\nNow, we’ve been down this road before. As many of you will remember, early rains in 2010 caused the BLM site inspection to be delayed by EIGHT MONTHS as we waited for Lake Lahontan to dry. When the seasons change out here, they do it on a dime.\n\nAND YET! Your Playa Restoration hotshots REFUSED to be grounded this year. I wish I could express to you what that means, what it takes to get people safely on and off the playa, not just people but busloads of DPW, fording actual rivers as the winds howl and the mud squelches. How many hours are spent by DA and his crackerjack team, just to find a route from the highway to the city. How many sleepless nights spent wondering… will we do it this time?\n\nIt’s not for the faint of heart.\n\nSpeaking of which, I’d like to introduce you to a couple of the stronghearted ones.\n\nAs part of my “people of Resto” series this year (read about Major Buzzkill and DA if you haven’t yet) I’m letting some of the fascinating individuals out here tell their stories. Trust me, there are some deeply moving stories in the hearts of the DPW.\n\nThis one is a love story.\n\nRando and Pocket are well known in many spheres of the global Burner community, and particularly in the AfrikaBurn world. This year, they joined Resto for the second time. They are a couple; he’s from South Africa and she’s from the States. They met at Burning Man in 2012, but the story starts well before that:\n\nLet’s Look at the Map, Hippies!\n\nNo more ado, I promise – here for you is Day Six in all its glory. Ready?\n\nHere’s what we’ve noticed about this year’s Moop Map: It’s really busy. It is detailed. Some of this may have to do with the evolution of our own record-keeping system. But some of it has to do with the way the dust flew this year, and how it buried many of the traces of Black Rock City in snaking, sandy dunes.\n\nThe power of a line sweep is that it can break down the dunes and get the moop beneath them. Add rakes to spread the dirt out a bit, and we can recover quite a lot of what was hidden. That’s a likely explanation for what’s going on this year, though I won’t claim to have the final answer.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAs I post this, the Resto team is wrapping up its very last muddy day, and I, for one, am glad my fingers are warm and dry as I type, instead of scrabbling in cold alkaline mud for bits of astroturf.\n\nLOVE and respect to the people of Playa Restoration. !",
