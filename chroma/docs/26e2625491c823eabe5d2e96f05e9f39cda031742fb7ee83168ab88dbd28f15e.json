  "content": "Since the arrival of the first art car on playa in the ’90s, Mutant Vehicles (MVs) have since evolved and become an intrinsic, awe-inspiring part of both the Burning Man event and culture. This series explores a handful of MV creators, artists, instigators, DMV (Department of Mutant Vehicles) volunteers, and the historical importance of these mobile pieces of art — a mix of engineering marvels and creative genius — and the people who bring them to Black Rock City. \n(Cover image of Mutant Vehicles in line at the DMV, 2017 • Photo by Philippe Glade)",
