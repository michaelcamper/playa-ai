As the train is leaving the station we want to let everyone know we’re planning for what’s next as we build on what we’re learning together.\n\n“Burning Man changed my life” is heard so often in certain circles these days that it’s become cliche. And yet for as many lives changed, so many of us are familiar with the feeling of wanting to do more — to bring the spirit of the playa into our everyday lives, only to find ourselves struggling with exactly how to do it.\n\nWe’re learning more about what Burning Man has to offer the world far beyond our own events and communities. Cities, cultural institutions, nonprofits, businesses, and leaders of all kinds are interested in working with and learning from us… people who have never been to a Burning Man event see value in what we’re doing and want to apply it to what they want to do.\n\nSo, how can we more effectively align our real-world realities with the culture of Burning Man? And how do we develop the skills and creative collaborations required to do this important work?\n\nBlack Rock City and the growing global network of events around the world are powerful and inspirational, but we’ve come to believe that our community in all its forms will benefit from a different kind of context for diving into these questions and more. And you’re invited to participate.\n\nSave the date, and join us for a global convening in the city of Reno, May 6–9, 2020. This event will bring together over 1,500 creators, connectors, and cultural ambassadors from the Burning Man community and beyond to ideate, learn, build networks, and support thriving year-round communities made stronger by their intelligent and conscious integration of Burning Man culture.\n\nIn the spirit of Radical Inclusion, we welcome everybody and anybody who seeks to explore the question of how we can, in very practical ways, bring the best of Burning Man culture into our projects, communities, and organizations.\n\nThis is a participatory event — a platform for learning and teaching, including over 100 talks, panels, and interactive sessions to generate enthusiasm, discussion and collaboration. You may choose to go deep around the things you hold most dear, or explore new topics while you meet interesting individuals with inspiring ideas from around the world.\n\nOf course, this won’t be some boring conference… there’ll be no shortage of exactly what you’d expect from a Burning Man gathering: participant created content, innovative thinkers and doers, new connections, meaningful ritual, and ridiculous fun — this event is a petri dish and lab for you and your ideas to flourish.\n\nPlease join us. Stay tuned for more details including opportunities to join the production team, pricing and scholarship information, content submission information, and more. Tickets will go on sale in mid-October.\n\nWe look forward to having you join us for the launch of a new Learning Man gathering exploring how we can build bridges between our realities and work to create a better world. Thank you for taking this moment while so much swells around Black Rock City to pause and imagine what’s coming around the corner and picturing yourself a part of it.\n\nReno August 2019 is the gateway for Burning Man, and Black Rock City. Reno May of 2020 is the next convening of the culture.\n\nTop photo: The Space Whale by The Pier Group with Matthew Schultz, Android Jones and Andy Tibbetts. (Photo courtesy of visitrenotahoe.com)",
