  "content": "As of last week, I’ve made 37 Playa Tips and Tricks videos over the last couple decades. They’ve covered everything from “How to deal with Shyness at Burning Man” to “Skin Care” to understanding the subtleties of “Gifting.” By this time, you are probably overloaded with advice and packing lists. But I have 2 final thoughts as you hit the road (for virgins AND veterans).\n\nThe first is a about your mindset:\n\nThe second is advice for anyone making videos out there:\n\nI can’t wait to hug you! See you at Home.\n\np.s. I’m hosting my annual “Pink Ride” at Pink Heart, 4:00 & Esplanade, at noon on Thursday)\n\nSearch the Burning Man Journal for more tips or visit PlayaPrinciples.com",
