  "content": "More than a couple of dreams came true last night, and we were lucky enough to be in attendance for the celebration. The first one was the launch of Burning Man’s new publishing arm, and the second was launch parties for two books by pivotal Burning Man figures.\n\nYou may already be familiar with the two books, which were published over the last two years. Built to Burn: Tales of the Desert Carnies of Burning Man by Tony ‘Coyote’ Perez tells the incredible stories of the people who go out and build Black Rock City in the middle of the desert so 70,000 participants can enjoy art and each other. Caveat Magister’s Turn Your Life into Art: Lessons in Psychomagic from the San Francisco Underground shares a practitioner’s tips and tricks on the art of engineering immersive and transformational experiences literally anywhere.\n\nWe also celebrated a third book that’s currently in production by Burning Man Publishing. It’s too early to announce here (as much as we’d like to). You’ll learn more when the right time is right.\n\nBeing an author is a long-time dream of Tony’s; his mom used to tell him all the time that he was going to grow up to be a writer someday. Last night was proof that it has happened. Publishing a book is just confirmation of what most of his friends already knew about him: Tony is a master storyteller.\n\nFor the launch party, what better setting could there be than Jack Kerouac Alley, between City Lights Bookstore and Vesuvio Cafe? The launch was indeed a San Francisco event, even though it was unusually warm and the wind was barely rippling. The conditions were downright pleasant in the alleyway — a very big surprise for a San Francisco night.\n\nAmong the celebrants were Stuart Mangrum, another principal in Burning Man Project’s publishing arm, and Andie Grace, a motivating force in the publishing division. Also at the event, George Post, long-time photographer and documentarian of the happenings in the desert, and Buck Down, who read a tremendously hilarious story of how Burning Man came to be in the desert in the first place.\n\nBuck recalled the day when some misguided police officer told gathered celebrants on Baker Beach that they would not be allowed to burn the Man on Labor Day weekend — lo, those many years ago. Without that thunderous ‘NO!’ from a middling bureaucrat, the event would never have traveled with The Cacophony Society on its Zone Trip to the Black Rock Desert, and all of the 30 years of history would have taken place someplace else.",
