You approach and find yourself standing at a martini bar, and you didn’t realize until that moment that a perfectly made, ice- cold vodka martini was in fact the exact thing you were really looking for.\n\nSome serendipities can be more spiritual, more nourishing for the soul.\n\nTell us about yours …",
