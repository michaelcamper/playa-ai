We thought you’d like to see them.\n\nWe welcome your feedback on this topic in the comments section below.\n\nGuidelines For Turnkey Camping\n\nIf you are a group of people who set up a camp – or hire help to set up a camp – with the explicit intention of having things ready to go in advance of the arrival of others, you are probably producing what we’ve termed “Turnkey camping”. In recent years, we’ve seen a rise in Turnkey camping services, and the Burning Man organization has decided to address the issue by providing guidelines for these camps and their organizers.\n\nTurnkey camps generally utilize outside service providers (better known as “vendors” outside our decommodified event). These services include deliveries, camp operations crews, and the organization of resources at campsites. Although camps have coordinated and pooled resources throughout Burning Man’s history, those resources and services are now more sophisticated and extensive than ever. It is now necessary that Turnkey camps be made aware of the impact they can have on Black Rock City.\n\nWe have established Ten Principles (below) that describe the ethos of our culture, and we have enacted certain rules that regulate civic life.\n\nThese new guidelines for Turnkey camps are an extension of this regulation. They are especially intended as advice concerning the customs and mores of our city that will help your camp to better contribute to our community.\n\nWe appreciate your participation in Burning Man!\n\nTurnkey Camping Guidelines\n\nAs the camp organizer, you are the ultimate responsible party that must ensure that the Ten Principles are honored and these Turnkey Camping Guidelines are followed by your camp and your service providers. Each person is expected to adhere to these as responsible citizens of Black Rock City. Please review these with each of your providers and/or operations teams.\n\nCamp Planning\n\nManaging Outside Service Providers\n\nBurning Man Culture\n\nBurning Man’s Ten Principles\n\nRadical Inclusion — Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.\n\nGifting— Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.\n\nDecommodification— In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.\n\nRadical Self-reliance — Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.\n\nRadical Self-expression — Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.\n\nCommunal Effort — Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.\n\nCivic Responsibility — We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.\n\nLeaving No Trace — Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.\n\nParticipation— Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.\n\nImmediacy— Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.",
