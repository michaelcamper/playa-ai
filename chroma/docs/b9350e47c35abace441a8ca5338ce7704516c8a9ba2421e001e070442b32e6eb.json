  "content": "There was a time (20 years ago) when participants brought guns to Burning Man. That time has passed and growth of Black Rock City and concern for everyone’s safety led organizers to ban weapons from the event. That ban continues with the 2014 event and we are again asking participants to leave their weapons at home.\n\nEach year Burning Man negotiates a Closure Order with the Bureau of Land Management that encompasses the event site and some of the surrounding playa. You can view the Closure Order area in the image below. The Closure Order is a public announcement that the Bureau of Land Management issues in collaboration with the Burning Man organization and includes temporary restrictions to protect public safety and resources on public lands.\n\nStaff and participants are forbidden to possess, carry or hold weapons on their person, in their camp, vehicle or dwelling in any area included in the closure order.  Anyone found with a weapon will be immediately removed from the event site.\n\nFrom the Closure Order:\n\nPlease do not threaten the future of the event – do not bring weapons to the Event Site for any reason!\n\nYou can read the entire closure order here.\n\nFor the record, pants cannons are still allowed.",
