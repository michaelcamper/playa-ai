We go there to get a glimpse of a more radical future and create the connections that will help us define and build that world together.\n\nIf we are to use Burning Man as a blueprint for that better world, we all have to take it upon ourselves to create the type of society that everyone actually wants to participate in.\n\nThe HYBYCOZO art crew would like to take a couple moments of your time to talk about creating progressive and radically inclusive environments on the playa, as well as some exclusive choices you might be making — even unknowingly — on your journey to Radical Self-expression.\n\nWe hope to open up a discussion of spiritual and cultural significance, diversity, and civic engagement at Burning Man and beyond.\n\nSo, what’s going on? As Burning Man has grown, we the authors have been shocked to see many people donning war bonnets and feather headdresses to party in. Those of us who are Native feel hurt and disrespected by this behavior. Just like the Burning Man community would not tolerate people walking around in blackface or perpetuating other racist stereotypes, we think it’s important to address the issue of appropriation from indigenous cultures.\n\nWe hope that sharing how this affects us will allow everyone to feel safe enough to share their own experiences and to fully hear the experiences of others. And we really hope that dialogue will lead Burners to question this practice and make more inclusive, more beautiful art together.\n\nWhat Is the Problem With Appropriating Native Dress?\n\nFirst, Native Americans in the U.S. and First Nations people in Canada have explicitly requested headdresses and war bonnets not be worn by people outside of the tribes that they come from. In Native communities, these items aren’t fashion choices, but rather are earned as symbols of respect, honor and achievement. As Dennis Zotigh of the National Museum of the American Indian says, wearing a war bonnet you didn’t earn is like tying a Medal of Honor or Purple Heart to your chest that you didn’t serve for.\n\nSecond, headdresses have a tendency to shed feathers, which is a major MOOP problem, so they probably shouldn’t even be at Burning Man in the first place.\n\nThird, you might be thinking, “But what about Radical Self-expression?” The question I would ask you: How is appropriating someone else’s culture your self-expression? If you’re wearing the ceremonial dress of people who tell you you can’t have it, how can you claim that expression as yours? Simply because you feel free to express yourself in a festival setting does not imply that it’s okay to appropriate someone else’s cultural heritage in the name of a killer Instagram shot.\n\nThe history of the dominant white culture is one of aggression, colonization and subjugation of people, extracting resources from their bodies, their cultures and their lands. That history is painful. You might think you’re celebrating those people, cultures and places by wearing their dress as fashion, but to them, it might just feel like more painful taking. Instead of inflicting that pain, why not listen to those people? Why not take the opportunity to explore your own heritage or more personal modes of expression?\n\nTo illustrate these points, our sister Dio, part of HYBYCOZO, virgin in 2015, and a member of the Iroquois Nation, would like to share her experience.\n\nWe’d also like to share another perspective from Allegra Lucas, HYBYCOZO Mama and fifth-year Burner.\n\nSo, beautiful Burner, you have meticulously packed your killer outfits, you’ve packed gifts to give others, you have your baby wipes, your furry bike, and you are ready for your transformational time in the desert. But right now you may be thinking, “Why are you trying to kill my vibe? I am just trying to express myself; I’m not hurting anyone.”\n\nBut cultural appropriation does hurt. You just might not be listening to the voices of people hurt by it. And now that you understand these voices better, you can DO better!\n\nBy all means, you should dress as sexy as you damn please. But is there a way to dress sexy without mocking someone’s violent history? Answer: Yes! Yes there is! Be creative! Research your art form with integrity! Up your fashion game with wisdom! Be radically expressive! It is Burning Man!\n\nThe ability to be sensitive, inclusive, and responsive to the concerns of people of color takes the willingness to listen. When you hear that your costume choices represent cultural appropriation, consider whether you want to be parading in regalia that send this message: I am not willing to stand with these people and their centuries of pain and say, I respect you, I hurt with you over the trauma that separates us in history, I love you and choose to make your concerns my priority. Instead, let’s make a shared, creative effort of love and identity that is respectful and grounded in the intent for peace and healing.\n\nWe hope, at least, that we all might become better listeners to the concerns of others. Radical Inclusion is not easy, folks. We are the sum result of our ethnicity, historical memory and upbringing. Add politics and economics, and it’s a thick damned shell to crack! It can be done. It’s happening little by little. May we all meet in the dust!\n\n(Top image: HYBYCOZO – Deep Thought, photo by Wendell DeLano)",
