  "content": "A sunrise on the playa is not something you’ll ever forget. In my mind, it’s like a single fluttering butterfly after an all-night pterodactyl rave. The sky is awash in pastels, the air is fresh and calm, and the creeping warmth of the sun heralds a new day. It feels good to be alive.\n\nSo many people have a sunrise story. In fact, Charlie “Dayburn” Wan’s whole life on the playa is not only oriented around catching the sunrise but also living each one to the fullest. He goes to sleep every night and wakes up as early as 3 am to be ready for the Great Ball of Fire’s magnificent appearance on the horizon. “The sunrises at the playa are everything to me. Nothing can give you better metaphor of life brought by the sun when the land is being warmed up every single minute,” he explains.\n\nIn five years of going to Burning Man, Wan’s never missed a sunrise — that’s 48 in a row now. In 2014, he created “Dawn of the Burning Sun,” a sunrise salutation concert and consciousness gathering that pairs introspective music he’s composed with mindful activities focused on connecting with nature, the inner self and emotions. “The sound is emotive, ethereal and cinematic. It was created to provide different experience for dayburners like me to have a serene morning outside of all the dance music” says Dayburn, adding that he hopes this will become an annual event on the Friday of the Burn and inspire others to create different types of sunrise events.\n\n“I advise those who love sunrise parties to wake up at 3 am. You catch the peaks of all the parties and you have full-on energy when the sun is up. Last thing that I want is to feel like I am ‘expiring’ and tired when I see this spectacular sun,” he continues. “If you’ve never done it, I highly recommended this. Many people have followed this little tip and changed their ways of experiencing dawn of the day at the Burn.”\n\nInspired by Wan’s enthusiasm for a time of day so many miss, we hungered for more stories about sunrise at Burning Man, including the personal epiphanies that rose up with our star. Here’s a peek at what was said and photographed:\n\nTop photo by Nikola Skubi",
