  "content": "The Leave No Trace Principle\n\nThe Burning Man community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.\n\nMatter Out of Place (MOOP) Defined\n\nIn Burning Man culture there is a word that we’ve coined, “MOOP”, an acronym for Matter Out Of Place, which means anything and everything that is not native to the immediate environment. Our environment, our home, is the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, affectionately known as “The Playa” which means simply that MOOP is everything. Leave Nothing. Leave No Trace.\n\nmoop  1. (noun) Acronym for Matter Out Of Place, meaning anything or any impact not native to the immediate environment, especially as it applies to the citizens of Black Rock City and the greater Burning Man community’s founding Leave No Trace principle. Some examples are cigarette butts, trash, bottles, fireworks, glow sticks, bottle caps, but can also be in the form of broken debris such as  wood, plastic, metal, glass, and plants. Moop can also be a condition not natural to the environment such as burn scars, fuel spills, grey/black water spills, and dunes. Sentence: “Your camp sure did leave a whole lot of moop on the playa!”\n\nmoop  2. (verb) To pick up matter out of place. Sentence: “Our camp mooped from one end of the block to the other!”\n\nmoop  3. (verb) To drop matter out of place. Sentence: “She mooped her cell phone somewhere on the playa and can’t find it.”\n\nUnderstanding the BLM Site Inspection of Black Rock City\n\nThe BLM Site Inspection, also known as the Post Event Inspection (PEI), is required following each Burning Man event per the following stipulation:\n\nThe BLM Site Inspection Standard for Allowable MOOP states that the average area is not to exceed one square foot per acre (1sq. ft/ac).\n\nOne acre is 43,560 sq. ft.\n\nSo, translating an acre into square feet, the allowable MOOP standard is 1sq. ft. for every 43,560 sq. ft. Think about the scale of that versus the size of a square foot!\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to visualize an acre is to imagine a football field without the end zones. To visualize one square foot you need only imagine something like a 12-inch vinyl record album cover. So essentially, if you were on a football field consolidating every tiny bit of MOOP and the total amount was bigger than an album cover–then you would be over the limit.\n\nBlack Rock City itself is 3,603 square acres or 156 million square feet. That’s A LOT of square feet. It’s a staggering number. That’s why the Burning Man community’s Leave No Trace effort is so important. It’s up to all of us.\n\nIf you’re thinking that an average of 1sq. ft./ac. is not a lot of MOOP for the amount of territory that Black Rock City occupies then you would be right. The BLM Site Inspection for Burning Man is a strict and tight standard to which no other event held on the Black Rock Desert or any other public land is subjected to and Burning Man is proud to have passed for all of these years since its inception in 1999 when the population was still only 23,000 participants.\n\nResults of the 2017 Bureau of Land Management’s Site Inspection Test\n\nAlthough still within the passing standards of the BLM Site Inspection, the 2016 results reported a rising trend for five consecutive years at .77 sq. ft/ac of MOOP, putting it in the danger zone of exceeding the allowable standard of 1sq. ft/ac.\n\nIn 2017 MOOP dramatically improved, falling from .77 sq. ft/ac to .35 sq. ft/ac! That’s more than a 50% improvement!\n\nWay to go Black Rock City! What’s it going to be for 2018? Stay tuned to the MOOP MAP 2018 blog as the Playa Restoration All-Star Team gets ready to take the field and root for the home team as we go head to head with the BLM Site Inspection 2018 on Monday, October 1st!",
