  "content": "Over the last couple years, Black Rock Solar has been busy sprinkling solar power arrays throughout northern Nevada.  In fact, they’ve been so busy, that Route 447 (from I-80 to Gerlach) now boasts the most (120kW) gifted solar power than any other route in the country.  It has thus been (unofficially) dubbed “America’s Solar Highway”.\n\nAnd what’s particularly cool is that you can see them from the road.  So if you’re driving 447 on your way to the Burn, keep an eye out for these solar arrays (in order):\n\nBlack Rock Solar is paving the way to socially-conscious radical self-reliance (from fossil fuels) in the real world.  Watch for these solar arrays along your way to Burning Man, and enjoy a nice smile of satisfaction when you spot ’em.",
