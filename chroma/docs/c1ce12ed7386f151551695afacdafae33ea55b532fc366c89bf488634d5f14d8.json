  "content": "It’s rare — actually near-impossible, if you want to talk about probability — to witness the emergence of a Multiverse. While multiversal realities containing infinite universes may be emerging continually, we’re not usually in the lucky position to be able to witness them.\n\nBut as always, Burners are often in unexpected places. This Build Week is quite unlike one we’ve lived before. The Burning Man Multiverse is being imagined and co-created by some exceptionally technologically adept and inspired Burners in our very own community — not just developers, but artists, theme camp organizers, performers — and many who you’d recognize!\n\nOf course you’re asking: “What the heck can I do in there? And how do I join all these phantasmagoric experiences during Burn Week?”\n\nWe’re here to help you with the logistics. Read on for easy information about how to access each and every Universe. You’ll also learn some of the scintillating details that are emerging, bit by bit, as the Recognized Universes of the Burning Man Multiverse populate their virtual worlds with myriad, intriguing and mind-blowing experiences.\n\nThe Infinite Playa\n\nWrap your mind around these interactive virtual stages, each uniquely created for The Infinite Playa.\n\nThe Cathedral is a beautifully lit gothic cathedral that can be entered through various portals that you may find deep in The Infinite Playa. As you enter this bejeweled structure, you may find your way “home” through portal windows that open to a performance venue and multiple experiential art worlds. Prepare your mind for otherworldly performances by The Fungineers, Saint Balls, DJ Snaggy and Spoolius.\n\nThe Mushroom is an educational and entertaining playground of Fantastic Fungi designed by Android Jones and Paul Stamets, among others. Featuring two stages, The Mushroom will be a place to engage with musicians and artists, accompanied by world class speakers and presenters. A place to be curious, to learn, to dance, and to feel.\n\nThe Infinite Playa at a Glance:\n\nMultiverse\n\nThe Multiverse crew is recreating 2020 Honoraria art installations to scale in their virtual world. These are the very installations you would have encountered on playa, had we been able to co-create Black Rock City this year. You’ll be able to explore and interact with them, as well as many well-recognized installations from Black Rock Cities past.\n\nPrepare yourself to shake some pixel-dusted playa booty at some of Black Rock City’s most renowned sound stages and mutant vehicles — including Playground, Opulent Temple, Sonic Soul Tribe, Incendia, Celtic Chaos and Mayan Warrior.\n\nMultiverse at a Glance:\n\nSparkleVerse\n\nCreators of SparkleVerse, a whimsical 4D Mixed Reality Universe, are delightedly rolling out the Museum of Consciousness, a magic cyberdelic museum co-created by world-leading consciousness hacker Carl Smith. All are encouraged to visit 15 unique spaces that will feature special audio instructions to shift your awareness and adventure your senses. As you move through the museum, you’ll build up altered states and altered traits and discover curious ways of perceiving the world.\n\nDuring Burn Week, the SparkleVerse creators enthusiastically encourage you to set up a tent in your living room, turn on a high-powered fan, and leave Zoom audio connected so random friends can wander into your camp and wake you up all night long.\n\nSparkleVerse at a Glance:\n\nMysticVerse\n\nBrought to you by the wildly creative folks behind Black Rock City’s Camp Mystic, MysticVerse is fully-centered around the spirit of Burning Man as a massive experiment of radical collaboration and participation. Artists from all over the world have gathered to make MysticVerse their virtual artist playground.\n\nKeep an ear to the ground for artist showcase day. Artists who have contributed to MysticVerse will be sharing the inspiration behind the art and their journey of co-creation.\n\nThe MysticVerse crew wants their Universe to be the most inclusive and accessible Burn ever. They’re enabling this through ADA-assisted and sensory enhancing experiences. Volunteers will offer their gift of narration and storytelling to guide differently abled people in their journey around MysticVerse.\n\nMysticVerse at a Glance:\n\nBRCvr\n\nBRCvr is rolling out a number of wondrous experiences, many from camps with which you may already be familiar!\n\nPlayAlchemist brings its Great Pyramid to BRCvr. This virtual homage will serve as a central hub for serendipitous connections, events, and dance parties. Hundreds of people can join in the events at one time, make eye contact and chat with their neighbors.\n\nIDEATE has developed a mind-bending virtual world with four stages: the Moon-shot Tea Lounge, an OuterSpace Ocean Stage, Neon Love, and Wild Truth: Illuminated. Most events will take place between Thursday and Sunday. IDEATE in collaboration with Empathy Co-op will be streaming a live Reno event — Love Aid Telethon, a variety show benefit for Burning Man Project.\n\nCurioCities is a new camp in the spirit of Science, Art and Cacophony! Come visit their tribute to early computer graphics, and a gallery featuring some of Black Rock City’s most loved photographers. Special music events and talks all week will offer highlights of Burner culture from the decades of Black Rock history.\n\nBRCvr at a Glance:\n\nBURN2\n\nThe folks in BURN2 have been doing this virtual Black Rock City thing longer than anyone else. Burners built the first Second Life virtual BRC experience way back in 2003.\n\nThe BURN2 community is ready for you! Prepare yourself for artfully created Burning Man spaces, and avatars dressed in stylish playa gear. During Burn Week they’ll be featuring  “Man museums” where you can drop in to explore virtual renditions of some of our favorite Man builds. They’ve invited past BURN2 artists to place their art during Burn Week. But don’t just come for the Burn; make you set aside time to explore a recreation of our favorite little town, Gerlach. Browse the full BURN2 schedule.\n\nThe BURN2 Second Life SIM, called Deep Hole, will be open 24/7 during Burn Week — anyone can drop in to explore. Start by downloading a Second Life viewer and creating your avatar. Then navigate to the Black Hole SIM. Note that the BURN2 environment can only accommodate 80 to 90 people at one time. Because of this, they’ll also be live-streaming Burn Week shenanigans on their Facebook page.\n\nBURN2 at a Glance:\n\nBuild-A-Burn\n\nThis adorable, explorable 2D Universe is offering up a playful collection of known and new theme camp experiences. Temple Burn Sunday at 4-7 PDT, stop by Ashram Galactica for a sunset set hosted by Beau Sebastian. Wander up to The Lost Penguin Cafe to join one of their playa famous open mic sessions (you’ll have to supply your own snow cone). Tune in for lounge music and alien conspiracy theories at The Dig, and throw down at Art Island for a mix of DJs, fire, glow flow and live digital painting. The main Build-A-Burn space will feature a mutant vehicle with a full lineup of DJs Monday to Thursday, 2pm to midnight PST.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Burning Man ephemera (who isn’t?) lose a few hours in Rome, which features an explorable landscape created from old, old Black Rock City photographs paired with recorded playa soundscapes. See you there.\n\nBuild-A-Burn at a Glance:\n\nThe Bridge Experience\n\nThe Bridge Experience is a mixed reality virtual experience created by Burners around the world and the Bridge Group from Miami’s Love Burn Regional event. Get ready to explore new spaces and ideas, and delve into spaces that blend music and art in an enhanced dimension.\n\nWith Enter The Dream Tank Portal, The Bridge Experience will feature a youth-created virtual reality experience. Join youth leaders from the Dream Tank social impact accelerator and think tank to play with purpose and discuss solutions to global problems. Take your senses for a ride at TheJediz Art Camp. They’ll be showcasing their collaborative artistic vision with a virtual reality spectacle blending digital art with music by Gucci Bass featuring DJ Qbert, Pushing Lotuses, Mn8 and others.\n\nAnyone with a device and a Chrome browser can participate in The Bridge Experience.\n\nThe Bridge Experience at a Glance:\n\nTop photo: “The Cathedral” created in The Infinite Playa by Meow Wolf\n\nMultiverse photo: “Cosmos” in Multiverse by Jen Lewin",
