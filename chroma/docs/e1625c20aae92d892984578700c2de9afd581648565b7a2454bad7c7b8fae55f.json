  "content": "You will never be rid of the playa,\nIt turns up when so least expected,\nSometimes,\nWhen you need it\nThe most.\n\nWhat unique aroma!\nThat dusty film,\nGrins back on each surface and fiber\nOf all that beheld\nBlack Rock City.\n\nYou ate it!\nYou inhaled it.\nInfused deeply into your lungs,\nIt crept silently into your heart,\nWhile it fed your very soul.\n\nIt’s become part of you,\nPerpetually imbedded,\nOn a molecular level.\nIt will never leave you,\nIt’s now your DNA.\n\nArt thou dust?\nThou art dust!\nSo softly taunts and beckons,\nArt.\nDust.\n\nTrue! Dust thou art,\nAnd, unto dust, you shall return.\nAh, yes, dear friend\nIt’s time to go back.\nHome!\n\nby Constance Hull",
