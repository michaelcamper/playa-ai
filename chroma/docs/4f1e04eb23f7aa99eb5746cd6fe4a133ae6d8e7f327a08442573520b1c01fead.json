  "content": "The 2015 Carnival of Mirrors theme was fully embodied in the Midway surrounding the Man, with its interactive carny booths created by 33 Regional groups and artists from around the world. All sorts of shenanigans took place as participants engaged with clowns, hucksters, shamans, doktors, professors, snake oil salesmen, kings of fun, mystics, fortunetellers, palmreaders, and harlequins.\n\nOne could compose and play music on a mysterious altar, win cotton candy at a ring toss game, get healed at a medicine show, build a drum, get exploited by corporate overlords, journey into the mind of the Man, create a mask, or become infinite. One could spin Fortuna’s wheel, consult with an Oracle, talk to an Oracultang, play pinball, get your chakra shocked, play an ice fishing game, spin a wheel of misfortune, marvel at freaks and oddities, and test your love, among other attractions.\n\nOne entered the Midway through four charming gateways created by Hugh D’Andrade; two grand stages hosted performers of all stripes, and after dark, fire spinners lit up the stages with their artistry. The whole grand and glorious sideshow was anchored by, of course, the Man itself, standing on a crazy red maze into which were tucked intriguing art treasures — if you could find them! Among other oddities, a gigantic skeleton was seen engaging with playful visitors day and night.\n\nAfter five days of intense activity, our Midway vanished. Left behind was the Man and the Maze, which of course went up in smoke after a spectacular pyrotechnic display.\n\nPlease enjoy this gallery of photographs.",
