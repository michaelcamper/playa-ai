  "content": "On November 15–17, 40 Burners from around the United States (plus Australia — heyyyy, Catnip) descended on Burning Man Project HQ in San Francisco to work on the next steps in implementing the Cultural Vision for Residential Black Rock City.\n\nPublished in July, this Vision was the first phase of the Cultural Direction Setting project that began in October 2018. The Vision outlines where we want the culture of Residential Black Rock City to be in the next five to 10 years and was built on widespread input from the community. It addresses our current challenges, sets a course for the future, and suggests changes to placement and other approaches over time.\n\nThe Phase 1 Vision Group — 19 theme camp leaders, Burning Man Project staffers, and camp placers — helmed the first phase of this adventure. Now we’ve moved into Phase 2, the implementation phase, which involves over 70 individuals across 10 working groups that focus on different sections of the Vision. (You can see who they are here.)\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nMost of these groups have been meeting since the Burn, and each one has been discussing big, juicy topics like theme camp criteria, tickets for camps, convenience camps and the 10 Principles, and strengthening our neighborhoods.\n\nThe November work weekend was the first time seven of the 10 groups came together to compare notes, and discuss and debate their recommendations and next steps. The goal was to emerge from the weekend with a clear list of consensus areas and items still to be resolved.\n\nMy group, the “Transparent Communication to Residents” group, split up and sat in on various sessions to listen, understand and synthesize where the conversations were heading. Our takeaways:\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nFor the groups themselves, a key takeaway was the power of coming together in one space to share thoughts, listen to perspectives and collaborate on how we make this vision real.\n\n“Our work was about having the tough conversations about what it takes to create a dynamic container in which each Burner can live their dreams,” said Marlon Williams, a member of Group 4 (Placement Process) and the Chakralicious and People of Color Camp, and the Assistant Director for Public Sector Innovation at Living Cities.\n\n“Meeting in person allowed us to truly connect and share stories, ideas and dreams for Black Rock City,” he said.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nShadow (Phase 2 Placement Team Identity Group, Phase 1 Visioning Group and Burning since ‘92!) cherished watching human nature at work, learning to see new perspectives, and being able to see and understand the person speaking them.\n\n“The seemingly casual conversations that would pop up after lunch or dinner or on a walk back from a break out session were very valuable,” she said. “That’s when ideas would come out or come into understanding. We had the time to flush things out. Hugs were helpful, too!”\n\nTop photo: Digging in the Zocalo meeting area at Burning Man Project HQ.
