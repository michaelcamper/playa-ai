We’re excited to see what MEDIATE Art Group has in store this time around. They are always pushing the borders of sound, projection, and performance in innovative ways to raise awareness of our relationship to our environment.\n\nWhen: Friday, June 5th, 2015 from 6:30pm – 10pm\nWhere: Obscura Digital, 729 Tennessee Street, San Francisco, CA\nCost: $20\nTickets: See the event page\n\nThere will be live music performances by Christopher Willits of ENVELOP, Elia Vargas and Nathan Blaz, as well as projection mapping by Azael Ferrer Gordo, interactive art installations, DJs, drinks, dancing and more.\n\nVisit MEDIATE Art Group’s website to learn more about their work.",
