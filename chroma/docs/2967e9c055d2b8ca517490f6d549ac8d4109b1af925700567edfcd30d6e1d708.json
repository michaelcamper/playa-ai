And play is associated with the ideas and symbols and commitments that we think of as powerful, having a strong effect on us, but not necessarily admirable.”\n\nBut in terms of how they work and the impact they can have on us, “play” and “ritual” may be manifestations of the same phenomenon: They both reshape how we think about and react to the world in the immediate moment, recasting the rules of what is and isn’t possible. And both can be very powerful influencers — teaching us things in ways that pedagogy alone cannot.\n\n“Anthony Wallace, an anthropologist who wrote about ritual learning, he refers to a special kind of learning that happens in some kinds of rituals, where experience is rapidly reorganized under special conditions, which results in big changes in cognition and emotion and learning,” she said.\n\nBut Heller goes further, saying that there is something else that fits neatly into the category created by ritual and play, at least in a Burning Man context: Art.\n\n“To me ‘play,’ ‘ritual,’ and ‘art are all these sort of meta-commentaries with sort of special realm of commenting and creating and imagining the way the world is, and the distinctions between those three things are not really important at Burning Man.”\n\nAnd that’s a key distinction between the Burning Man experience of these forms of meta-action, and the experience of them elsewhere.\n\n“In the default world you to go a museum for art, your church for ritual, your gym or your sporting event for play, and you don’t have those three domains overlapping very often.\n\n“I think that’s very unfortunate, because the creative aspects of art, the significance of things we call ritual, and the freedom or learning that can take place in the playground — when those things get separated out and they can’t build on each other. So the fact that we get to do them all at the same time in whatever combination we want to, I think makes Burning Man a more powerful experience, the effect of meta-action, the power of meta-action, working in the realm of ideas and symbols, is ramped up, in a way.”\n\nThe combination of those elements may be part of what makes Burning Man such a liminal space, full of possibility, out of time, and super-saturated with meaning. You are constantly surrounded by art, by rituals, and by play, and they all interact with each other to create a unique and powerful environment.\n\n“That to me is Burning Man,” she said.\n\nListen to our whole conversation in this podcast from the Burning Man Philosophical Center.",
