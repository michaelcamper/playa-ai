This imaginary space is an alternative to conventional configurations of music performances. It translates music into an immersive landscape of lights in motion. Merging sound and space, SoundScope proposes a synaesthetic experience to the audience.\n\nThe Art Installation uses multiple projections onto translucent materials alongside surround sound technologies to create an augmented 3D environment responding to music. The amplitude, frequency and duration of each note is translated into a unique pattern in motion. The sound, visual and spatial language of SoundScope is inspired by water motions, from rain to storms, agitated to calm seas.\n\nThis mathematical and emotional translation aims at providing the visitors with an intuitive spatial insight into music. It is set in a reflective environment enhancing the endless nature of this imaginary journey.\n\nThis project is supported by Burning Man Arts / Black Rock Art Foundation and Londonewcastle Project Space.",
