  "content": "Burners will be gathering at FreeSpace — a 14,000 sq ft warehouse in San Francisco’s SOMA district hosting a month-long pop-up community center focused on hacking the civic experience — this weekend for BurnerHack. BurnerHack is an opportunity to learn, share and teach a wide variety of skills to help one prepare for the playa (or wherever you want to take them!).\n\nThe offerings include such things as hacking arduino software, working with LEDs, making costumes, soldering el-wire, building shelters, Mutant Vehicle modifications and more. Take a look at the full listing of projects so far, and add yours into the mix on the BurnerHack website.\n\nBurning Blogger Jon Mitchell will be attending and will report on both BurnerHack and the FreeSpace concept for us after the weekend. If you plan to attend, and would like to hook up with him while you’re there, ping him on Twitter at @ablaze.\n\nFreeSpace is located at 1131 Mission Street, San Francisco.",
