  "content": "What can you do; it happens to the best of us. Love strikes like lightning out there. But now that it has happened and your heart is mightily aflutter…what next?\n\nMay I suggest listening to the latest episode of the Burning Love Podcast. Veteran Burner and therapist Dr. Beth Gadomski joins the show to share some wise words on love in the dust. Beth is this podcast’s dream guest. One of her clinical specialties is counseling Burner couples navigating the mysteries and travails of love on and beyond the playa. In this episode, she discusses the importance of integrating the best aspects of our Burning Man selves into our everyday lives to help playa love make the leap between There and Here. She also explains why the No Dogs on Playa Policy helps us fall in love faster.\n\nShe did not dye her hair to match this podcast.\n\nHappy listening.",
