  "content": "Long before I learned about Burning Man, David Bowie taught me about Radical Self Expression.\n\nHe was gay. He was bi. He was married to Iman. He dressed like a man, like a woman, like an alien. He was whatever the fuck he wanted to be. “Fuck you, labels, I’ve got a creative vision to listen to!”\n\nI am so grateful that I now have a massive community of artists and weirdos (aka Burners) to connect with, but at one time, David Bowie was the shining freak example that made me feel better about being outside the box.\nI know I am not alone is having my life impacted by his to-the-hilt expression of “Life as Art.”\n(I predict a whole lotta Ziggy Stardust in the Temple this year.)\n\nDavid Bowie has always been a constellation. Now his body has joined his spirit.\n\nDavid Bowie\n1947-2016",
