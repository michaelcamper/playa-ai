  "content": "This came across our radar, and we’d be hard-pressed to imagine a faster/easier/better way to bring Burning Man principles into your local community — and if the folks who came up with this aren’t Burners, we’d be utterly shocked (albeit pleasantly surprised).\n\nIt’s called NOW! festival. Here’s how it works: they pick two weeks a year and encourage people to come up with free and nearly free awesome experiences that serve to “co-create the best possible version of our community for one extraordinary week.” Sound familiar? Thought it might.\n\nSo people list their ideas on the website, and the listings are as much an advertisement as an inspiration to others to get off their duffs and create something as well (we’re digging the “Me Too” button).\n\nThe list of events reads like Black Rock City’s What Where When guide, only less completely insane. Somebody’s offering a concierge service outside the DMV, another’s hosting a ukelele jam. There’s a tetherball competition, a conversation about healthy eating, and a mobile bike repair station. And of course there’s a “Psychic Friends Pop-Up Healing Station” and a “Midnight Pajama Silent Disco”. And that’s just scratching the surface.\n\nBasically, it’s great stuff that makes any neighborhood a better place to be, pulled together by people who want their neighborhood to be a better place.\n\nIt’s happening in San Francisco’s Panhandle neighborhood this week, so check it out if you’re in the area.\n\nAnd for God’s sake people, please create one of these in your home town!! They’ve got a handy How To guide and a FAQ for all your questionings.\n\nWe tip our hat to these fine folks making great things happen.",
