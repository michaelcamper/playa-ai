  "content": "Welcome to Building Man, where participants get to see exactly how mind-bogglingly difficult it is to build big art in the middle of a desert.\n\nMany of the big art pieces were yet to open by Monday night, including the Man himself, who alas as of this writing was still upside down and headless, attached to a drive shaft that wasn’t spinning. He was the centerpiece of a city square of artisan workshops, which have welcomed participants when access was possible.\n\nThe Vitruvian Man had been raised on Saturday, in a stress-filled, complicated two-crane lift. He was nestled into place successfully, but later in the day, when builders attempted to rotate the circle in which he is mounted, bolts were sheared and all movement came to a halt.\n\nSince then, we’ve watched and hoped that the Man would be revived, but word came Tuesday that the goal now was to get the Man upright, put on his head, declare victory and move forward.\n\nMeanwhile, work was also continuing as of Monday night at the Catacomb of Veils, the Lighthouse and the Temple, but it looked like gates would soon be open at the latter two.\n\nIt all made you wish that Burning Man’s run could be extended for at least an extra few days, so that the ambitions of the artists could be realized and their work properly appreciated.\n\nBut those are considerations for another day. For now, we’ll go on our way about the city, and pictures will tell the story of Just Another Day at Burning Man:\n\nMorning at the Center Café\n\nAll manner of folks gather here, to see and be seen, and it seems like early in the day early in the week is the best time to find people easing into their burn, bringing their gifts. Click through into the gallery for the captions and the stories\n\nThe lines of people in Ring Road waiting for ice were long, but once inside Artica, go-go-dancers made the wait seem worthwhile.\n\nSome women from the DPW roamed the streets with a tub of bacon, the largesse of Spectrum Catering. There can never be too much bacon in Black Rock City\n\nIs there golf in Black Rock City? Why yes, there is.\n\nA celebration was held to mark the unification of the Artery and the Everywhere Pavilion. It began on the Esplanade and processed out to the playa:\n\nA lovely way to get around:",
