  "content": "Welcome home, they said\nas I drove through the gate.\n\nAnd I felt it, and said it too –\nto others as they arrived.\n\nBut this place isn’t anyone’s home.\nIt is a barren wasteland of a desert.\n\nFilled for a week with 30,000 neo-hippies,\ncarting around their Costco-sized provisions\nlike prizes from a hunt.\n\nNo – there is no home here.\n\nThis feeling of home we brought with us,\nor created here together on this blank playa canvas.\n\nWe did not find it here waiting. We made it. It is ours.\n\nThey tell us as we enter to be on the lookout\nfor “Materials Out of Place,” and to pack this MOOP out when we find it.\n\nBut is there anything more out of place in the desolate Black Rock Desert\nthan a feeling of love, community, and home?\n\nLet’s not forget to carry this particular MOOP\naway with us when we leave.\n\nby Chris Dunphy",
