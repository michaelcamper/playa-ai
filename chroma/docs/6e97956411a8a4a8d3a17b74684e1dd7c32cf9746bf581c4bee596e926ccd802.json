It highlights videos that capture the reverie and reverence of Black Rock City — where we celebrate community and creativity in a crucible of ideas, art, and technology — and illuminates the global reach of Burning Man culture. In short, this channel tells the story of Burning Man’s evolution in the world, including reminders of the past, landmarks for the present and inspiration for the future.\n\nWe invite your participation!\n\nHave you made a film inspired by your Burning Man experience? Do you have a piece of wisdom to share with your fellow Burners? What would you tell your virgin Burner friends preparing for their first trip to the playa? How has Burning Man changed your life? How will you tell the story?\n\nTo submit your piece for consideration, please take a look through the existing videos to get a sense of what’s being offered, and then visit our submission page to get the process started.\n\nYouTube Channel FAQs and Guidelines\n\nQ: How do I submit my video to Burning Man for consideration for inclusion in the channel?\n\nA: To submit videos for consideration, please use the upload tool. Please make sure the video is marked as “public” and that you have turned off the advertising option. (Should these requirements not be met, we won’t add your piece to our channel.)\n\nQ: Are all submitted videos added to the YouTube channel?\n\nA: No. Burning Man’s YouTube channel is curated and not all videos submitted for consideration will be posted. This channel serves as a motion picture museum — a storytelling vehicle for Burning Man worldwide. Thus, we are selective about which videos are included.\n\nQ: What types of videos will be added to the YouTube channel?\n\nA: Selected videos demonstrate or explore any of the following:\n\nCurators select exemplary videos. They are well-made, unique, demonstrate good camera work, excellent editing, a quality soundtrack and an enjoyable storyline.\n\nQ: I’ve submitted my film, but have yet to hear back. Is somebody asleep at the wheel?\n\nA: It may take some time to review your film. Please allow 90 days to receive a response, especially if you submit in August or September.\n\nQ: Do I need a professional use agreement with Burning Man before submitting my work to the Burning Man’s YouTube channel?\n\nA: No. This YouTube channel is a tool for sharing your work with the Burning Man community, friends and family. You do not need a professional use agreement on file with Burning Man. Please read Burning Man’s Rights and Responsibilities before filming at the event or submitting a video you’ve made to this channel. If you hope to do something more than submit your work to Burning Man’s YouTube channel, regardless of your profit motive, you will need to request a contractual agreement and specific approval by emailing press (at) burningman (dot) com (press@burningman.com).\n\nQ: Some of the recognizable people I’ve included in my film never gave me their permission. Is it okay to submit it anyway?\n\nA: No. In submitting a film to Burning Man’s YouTube Channel, you acknowledge that all featured participants in your film have given their permission to use their image. It is policy — and really good etiquette — for you to let them know you plan to share the footage with a much wider audience than your own friends and family. If you can’t contact recognizable individuals in your shots, use other footage.\n\nQ: What films will you definitely not select?\n\nA: Any content depicting illegal acts, violating copyright laws, portraying violence, or anything else we deem inappropriate or in opposition to the 10 Principles will not be considered.\n\nQ: Why host videos on YouTube? Doesn’t that go against the principle of Decommodification?\n\nA: While we recognize there are other online sites through which many Burners host video, we have chosen YouTube because it is easy to use, is well-supported, and has an international audience. In an effort to protect our principle of decommodification, Burning Man will not select videos that allow the advertising feature.\n\nRemember, by submitting your film to Burning Man’s YouTube channel, you agree to let Burning Man share your work publicly on the Burning Man YouTube channel.",
