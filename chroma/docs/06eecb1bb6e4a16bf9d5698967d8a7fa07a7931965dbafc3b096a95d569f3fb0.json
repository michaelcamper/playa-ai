  "content": "So you’ve devoured BurningMan.com and memorized the Survival Guide?\n\nNow that you know how to avoid death, dehydration and dismemberment, are there any other tips for making Burning Man even more amazing?\n\nYoubetcha! Several years ago I started recording collections of things I’ve learned over many years of participation. (This will be my 14th Burn.)\n\nPart 1 includes: BASICS, GLUE GUN, GLOVES, WET NAPS, WATER TRUCK, PISS BUCKET, SOCKS, & SHOES.\n\n(NOTE: I’m told that water trucks contain non-potable water and should not be used in the way described in the video. And ALL of these tips are solely the views of Halcyon and do not represent the The Burning Man Organization or Major League Baseball. Also, “Gifting It” is no longer available at that URL, but can be found in the Burning Man marketplace.)\n\nStay tuned for more tips! Have some tips? Share in the comments!",
