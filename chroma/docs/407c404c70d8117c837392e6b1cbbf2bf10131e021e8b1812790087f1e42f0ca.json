These comments were part of her closing remarks at the European Leadership Summit in Aarhus, Denmark, on April 11-14, 2019.\n\nThe European Leadership Summit is one of the most moving events for me. It means so much to be doing what we’re doing and to do it in Europe. What you all are doing in this part of the world, which has its own challenges, its own political friction, its own religious challenges, its own border challenges — I’m really inspired by it. To me, you’ve got bigger challenges than I do in the United States.\n\nAnd that’s why I’m so touched by the Ukrainian team, which told me a story last night that really reminded me why I do this and why it is really important for you all to do this. Then I want to go through a list of some of the leadership principles that I want to remind us of.\n\nThe Ukrainian team told me how they were at Burning Man working to put together their art and their camp, and their water services hadn’t come yet. And who do you think helped them? The Russian team.\n\nSo I really want to remind us that we are — despite what some of our politicians think or say — one big globe of humanity, that Burning Man is not political, it’s not religious, we go beyond borders and we’re really here to help one another. We know that what Burning Man culture can do is give people a sense of change, give people a sense of the world as bigger than themselves and really connect people one on one. That’s the most magical experience.\n\nDoing the Work for Those Downstream\n\nBut sometimes the last group to come online is the group that gets the benefits of all the work that we’ve been doing. So each one of you that is doing the work that you’re doing, and the challenges you have with your governments and in your media, and the interpersonal challenges you have in your community, the rewards of you accomplishing and working through them are absolutely going to be felt downstream.\n\nSo I want to encourage you to continue to lead. Lean into those challenges, learn from those challenges and share your learnings. What I’m doing is really encouraging you to be your best selves, to share with each other, to go beyond the borders.\n\nAnd when you go out into the world, I want you to reflect on how the gem of who we are is not always what it looks like to you. It’s not always the folks that might be dressing like you. It’s not always the playful ones. It’s not always the obvious ones.\n\nThere are people looking for a way to be real and to live their lives, and you need to give them an opening to connect and then to give them creative opportunities. We know that the cultural storyline of Burning Man is going to move by gathering in an open place together and storytelling about what’s meaningful, to do things like Burners Without Borders-type projects, to experiment with ideas of governance, and to gather people together that may not go to Black Rock City and give them the chance to tell their stories.\n\nLeadership Qualities\n\nSo I want to walk through leadership qualities in Burning Man culture. We use them inside the organization now to ask ourselves what is it we’re looking for in each other, and we often do it out in the world with the Regional Network. And when we’re hiring someone, we ask essay questions that include some form of questions about these leadership qualities so we can learn more about people.\n\nOne of them is inspiring. A great leader inspires others to be collaborative. A great leader collaborates with all key stakeholders on any issue.\n\nActive listening and communicating. A great leader actively listens to others ideas and communicates timely and important information. Remember there’s others besides yourself that are working to create Burning Man culture in the world. So take the moment to explain to them what you’ve learned, why it’s important. What are the qualities of what you’ve learned to carry on to the next project or group?\n\nA great leader is accountable, reliable, and follows through on commitments.\n\nSelf-aware. A great leader is self-aware of their abilities, development and communication. That one’s often really challenging because we think we’re self-aware until we do that thing that nobody quite gets why you just did it. And then being available for the feedback is super important.\n\nPatient. A great leader is patient with themselves and others.\n\nAppreciative. A great leader shows appreciation to everyone who contributed to a particular project or our idea. Remember that one, just a little bit of appreciation goes a long way.\n\nAct with integrity. A great leader has personal integrity and is honest, ethical and professional. It is so hard sometimes when we’re in the groove, we’re letting loose and what is professional starts to look a little different. But if we’re at a Burning Man-related event and we’re in a leadership position, that is the best time to remember that showing up to be representative of the culture is more important than having another cocktail.\n\nEmotionally intelligent. A great leader is in touch with their emotions, strengths, weaknesses, drives, values, and goals, and recognizes their impact on others. An emotionally intelligent leader also displays empathy for others.\n\nComfortable in the gray areas. We’ve talked a lot about this one in the organization. Sometimes it’s the hardest one for people that are out in the world. It’s either yes or it’s no, or it’s right or it’s wrong, or it’s black or it’s white, or it’s a rule or no rule. But I think with Burning Man, that’s what we’re doing is creating new rules and new language and new pathways so you need to be comfortable in the gray areas. A great leader has the ability to navigate issues that do not have a clear-cut solution, by using intuition, collaboration and mindfulness.\n\nLooks for great benefit versus the immediate goal. A great leader is focused on the maximum benefit for the community as opposed to the personal or short-term gains.\n\nPerceives the big picture. A great leader is focused on seeing the largest possible perspective of any particular project and communicates this vision to others on the team.\n\nLeading by example. A great leader is someone who leads by example and is not afraid to get their hands dirty in the process. I frankly have seen that done so well out in the Regional community.\n\nLeaves ego behind. A great leader is in it for the greater good and not for the personal gain. Right? It’s not about yourself. It’s not about how others see you as that great leader. If you’re feeling too powerful as a great leader, that’s the time when you should step out of the way and let someone else take the front stage. This always makes me nervous being up here, and when it’s not my turn anymore, I have to be ready to step away.\n\nLeads outside of the organization in the community. A great leader is one who embodies these values even when they are not on duty.\n\nOpen to new ideas. A great leader is someone who is open to new ideas. Curious. A great leader suspends assumptions and judgment and brings inquiry and curiosity to everything you do.\n\nThe last one is Fun. A great leader knows how to make work fun for everyone involved.\n\nWe’re Burning Man cultural citizens, and we’re citizens in our own communities, cities, countries and in the world. And so I shared those leadership principles so you can think about what it means to be a good citizen, a good leader and a good person. And we can embody those qualities and share them with others so that a Burning Man citizen really becomes the best person that each one of us can be.\n\nThank you!\n\nTop photo: European community leaders gather at ELS.
