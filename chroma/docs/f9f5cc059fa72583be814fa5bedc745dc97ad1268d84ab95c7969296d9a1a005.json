  "content": "I spent the last week working on the Dream Swing at The Generator in Sparks, NV.   This place is amazing. (Check out this blog post by Affinity to learn more about it.)\n\nDuring breaks from our project, I’ve been able to meet a number of amazing artists and admire their creative processes.\n\nWant to get a feel for what the vibe is like at the Generator as Burners are preparing for BRC 2016? Check out the archives of these scrappy live broadcasts:\n\nTalking with Colin O’Bryan and Phoenix of “Inside the Mind of Da Vinci”\n“I’m looking for a Master – who is actually producing something that I admire…and that’s who I build with… and that’s what I consider collaboration.”\n\nInterview with Kesley about “The Space Whale”\n“It starts with a dream…a whale as the perfect ambassador…”\n\nInterview with Lindsay of The Generator\n“I’m the MacGuyver…I’m the one that comes up with solutions…”\n\nMe helping with the Pink Heart Dream Swing (co-hosted by 8 year old Kam):\n“I am still a little limited with my skills…”\n\nI’m so grateful to everyone involved in The Generator. I can’t wait to see your projects come alive in the dust!",
