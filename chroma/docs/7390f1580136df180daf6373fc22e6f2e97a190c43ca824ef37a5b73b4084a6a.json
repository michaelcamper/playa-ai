  "content": "I’ve heard nothing but glorious things about this year’s Black Rock City — lots of people saying that it was their best year ever.\n\nBut most of the online discussion about it was still as awful as ever. Honestly, if I didn’t already know and love us from all my in-person experiences, I probably wouldn’t want to have anything to do with us based on what I see on my social feeds.\n\nSo I was struck by a social media post by Halcyon noting that “the magic of Burning Man community has never translated into positive online socializing.”\n\nHe explains that:\n\nI agree, but it’s not just “in Black Rock City” as opposed to the “default world.” It’s all the conversations that we try to have online. Over the years I’ve gone across the U.S. and (to a much more limited extent) the world, having challenging conversations with Burners about this thing we do, its philosophy, and its cultural implications. And every time — literally every time — the conversations that we had in person went much, much, better, than they ever do online. Even when the same people were involved. Often, the in-person discussions of difficult topics felt very much like Burning Man — playful, experimental, courageous, kind. The online discussions almost never do.\n\nThis isn’t unique to us, of course: pretty much the only thing we can count on in this world is that talking about something online makes it worse. It’s a difficult dynamic because we are social creatures. Just as it’s harder to live the 10 Principles in the default world because everybody around us is living as if they’re in the default world, it’s even harder to live the 10 Principles online because, well, everybody is behaving the way they’ve been conditioned to behave online. The way the structure of online communications is essentially designed to encourage.\n\nAs I wrote a few years ago:\n\nIt’s not our fault, but it is something that we have to deal with. Because while we have tried, with some success, to use digital avatars as means of improved communication (the talks in Burn2 and the VR Burning Man tended to at least be civil), we are clearly not reaching the standards we hold for ourselves. And so either we need to figure out how to be keep our standards online, or we need to be upfront: Burning Man is fundamentally an in-person phenomenon. You have to show up, in person, to get the experience right.\n\nIs that true? Can we not do online what we were able to do in one of the harshest physical environments on earth?\n\nHere’s What I’ve Tried\n\nI’m open to that possibility, but right now I’m betting against it.\n\nFirst because I don’t think we’ve really put our minds to trying. We collectively put so much more effort into our BRC theme camps than we do our online dialogue — we shouldn’t conclude we can’t do anything until we’ve really tried something.\n\nSecond because my own experience trying to create “Burning Man” type experiences over Zoom during the pandemic taught me a great deal about how to successfully shift from in-person to online experiences. And while “making art experiences” is different from “having a positive community dialogue,” I think some of the lessons will cross-over. Or at least support the search for a new approach.\n\nMy general design elements for creating “psychomagical experiences” in the style of Burning Man and the San Francisco art underground are quickly summarized here. All of those apply, but interpreting them for an online environment was not a simple task.\n\nI wrote about my efforts to create Burning Man-like experiences here, here, and here (and a few other places), but a summary of what I learned is below. I want to be clear about something first, though: this is not my list of how I think things should work, or how I want them to work, this is my summary of what did work. The ideas emerged from trial and error. It is also not meant therefore to be an exhaustive or exclusive list: if other people get results that “feel like Burning Man” doing other things, great! Tell me how you did it so that I can try it too!\n\nThat said, here goes:\n\nI suspect the same thing is true of online conversations. Part of the problem with those conversations is that people jump in, throw a grenade, and then hop out again, repeating the process at their leisure. A better online dialogue might require people to stick around.\n\nThe more of such risks you manage to tie into an experience, especially one that does last for a prolonged period, the greater an experience of authentic engagement, connection, and even magic is likely to emerge.\n\nThis works great for art experiences, but seems like it is going to be particularly difficult to transition over to community dialogue, where you want people to feel safe expressing themselves. Social media is also a places where too many people see edgelord behavior as “risky,” when in fact it is perfectly safe from behind a keyboard dealing with people who you’ll likely never meet. It’s so convenient to flame someone, so easy and risk free it is to just pile on someone you disagree with. Which brings us to the next point:\n\nThere’s a few other things but this list has gone on long enough and those are the big ones … I think. Again, the point isn’t that I’m right about anything in particular, the point is that this is what I’ve found works for creating online events that actually “feel like Burning Man,” and maybe there’s something helpful here for other efforts to better ways to communicate online.\n\nTrying Together Is More Important Than Being Smart Alone\n\nBut it’s also worth remembering that biggest reason Black Rock City and other Burning Man spaces are so different isn’t just that we have better ideas; in fact, Burning Man had been going on for 18 years before the 10 Principles were developed.\n\nThe important thing was that we decided to actually do things differently when we were in a Burning Man cultural space, and enough people committed to that and joined in the ethos that new people who came looked around them and saw a culture that truly worked differently. The reason it’s so difficult to be your best Burner self in the default world is that you have very little support for it — most strangers give you weird looks when you try to give them gifts, you have to really coax people into acts of Radical Self-Expression, and there’s an active hostility to Radical Inclusion these days. It’s so, so, much harder to carry the torch alone.\n\nBut when we come together, we find brilliant ways of making it work. Culture is not like physics — it can be changed by people who commit to it. The important thing wasn’t just that our ideas were better, it’s that we threw ourselves into the experiment together and followed what worked.\n\nI suspect the same dynamic is true with online spaces. The problem isn’t that we’re bad people (or at least no worse than anybody else), the issue is that we have inherited a set of terrible behaviors for online conversation, and we revert to them.\n\nIt’s a free country (more or less) and so we’re not going to ever stop people from saying whatever they want on their own social media forums, nor should we try. We don’t need to be scolds, we don’t want to be scolds — in fact, the endless rounds of accusations and bad faith attacks are what we want to move away from. We can do this playfully. We can try to do better in a spirit of experimentation, a spirit of “what happens if?”\n\nAnd if enough people get together and try to have important conversations online in a different way, if in their own spaces they develop alternatives and try them together, it will so much easier to change the way we relate online than just handing people a sheet of rules. Seeing other people do it is far more effective than being told how to do it, especially when it looks like the people doing it are having more fun, and being more productive.\n\nWe are social creatures. The point isn’t necessarily that we succeed so much as that we are trying together, and having a better time for it. I believe Burning Man culture can create better internet conversations — it will just go through some phases where we fail first and look absurd doing it. That’s okay, that’s our happy place. We can make our online communities feel like theme camps if we apply the same creativity and effort.",
