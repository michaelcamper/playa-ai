  "content": "Burners know how much art one can pack into a box truck, but Everyhere Logistics is about to raise the bar. This team, spread out all across the United States, is rolling out multiple convoys of box trucks full of pop-up art exhibitions to traverse the country, descending upon a different U.S. city each Saturday in August. In each city, the trucks will join up with a local Lost Horizon Night Market, an interactive art carnival experience that will welcome in the locals. The point is to demonstrate how portable and scalable even big, inspiring art experiences can be.\n\n“There is a myth that viable art is only found on the coasts and in a select few big cities,” the trailer video says. “Help Everyhere Logistics shatter that myth.”\n\nThese people want to build a national network of such Night Markets, to make them a part of the fabric of city life, and nailing this crazy trucking part would enable the free flow of art and artists across this network. You can help them make that happen on Kickstarter for just a few more days.",
