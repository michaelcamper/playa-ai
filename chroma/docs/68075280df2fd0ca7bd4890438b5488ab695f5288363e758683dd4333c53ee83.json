  "content": "Today is the day that many of us have been anticipating for weeks or months or years: The day that we leave our default realities for the playa.  After  all of the packing and preparation,  we’ll get into one kind of vehicular pod or another and scurry off to the desert, fixated on just one thing: getting to the other side of the Greeter’s station.\n\nRites of Passage is my 12th burn. I’ve often wished that I “had time” to stop in some of the beautiful places we pass through on the way to Black Rock City. After I made it into California I noticed that the stars were amazing, and the moon was starting to rise and had to stop and take it all in.\n\nI find the Surprise Valley to be especially beautiful. This year it was just starting to get light as I made my way over Cedar Pass and I saw that a spectacular sunrise was about to unfold, so I pulled over and shot this four-frame panorama.\n\nA little further South is Eagleville, and the sunrise was still indeed amazing.  I caught the tail end of a Burner’s Airstream in one of my photos.\n\nAnd then the sun was up, and I was in Nevada, and that’s where the cattle grates begin to appear in earnest. That’s when you know you’re getting close to home.\n\nSpeaking of home I know you’re all thinking, gee, Holden, this on the road stuff is great, but how about some photos from the playa? Well, I’ll leave you with this one, and promise to post a bunch more soon….as I write this the sky is just starting to get light and there is some amazing art that I need to go photograph.",
