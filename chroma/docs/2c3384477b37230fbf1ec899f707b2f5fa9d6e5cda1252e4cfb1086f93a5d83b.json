  "content": "~ Leaving No Trace ~\nThe Burning Man community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.\n\nI’ll be straight with you, Black Rock City: The map I have to show you today is not from Burning Man 2014. It’s not from Burning Man at all. It’s not even from this continent.\n\nToday, I’m proud to show you the 2014 Moop Map from Tankwa Town, South Africa.\n\nIn 2013, the Burning Man DPW had the privilege to host Sonica Kirsten, AfrikaBurn’s LNT Lead. Sonica walked the moop line as part of the Playa Restoration crew, sharing knowledge, experiences and friendships with us.\n\nSonica instituted AfrikaBurn’s first Moop Map last year; it’s greener overall than Burning Man’s first Moop Map, and it only improved after 2014’s event.\n\nRead more about AfrikaBurn’s event, community and LNT work at AfrikaBurn.com.\n\nNo Trace at Nowhere!\n\nLiss Morgan, LNT lead for Spain’s Nowhere event as well as for Nest (Wales) and London Decompression, shares a big success story from another distant desert:\n\nWhat’s Your LNT Story?\n\nThe Burning Man Regionals Network is an incredibly diverse, vibrant community that spans the globe. Do you attend a regional event? Please share your experiences, challenges, successes and inspirations. How did you manage to Leave No Trace, and what did you learn?\n\nBlack Rock City, please share your stories too!\n\nWe know you’re on tenterhooks waiting for the next Moop Map scores. The Playa Restoration crew is compiling them as fast as possible (a process that happens at night after we’ve put in a full day of work in the desert). Please be patient with us, the next Moop Map installment is coming very soon!\n\nWant more photos & goodies from the Playa Restoration team? Search #BM2014.
