The couple cherished their playa time as a chance to deepen their relationship (they eventually married in Black Rock City), but too often they found themselves on a quest for a calm, cozy place to connect.\n\nAfter seven years of seeking, they did what any sensible Burner would do: they decided to create the thing that they wanted themselves. This was the genesis of “Owl’s Nest,” a sweet outpost that offered a refuge for participants needing some downtime. The heated, pillowed structure emitted soothing sounds and offered little baggies of dried fruit for nourishment. It comfortably held two people, although Daria once witnessed seven ‘birds’ snuggling inside.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nBringing art to Black Rock City was a natural next step in the couple’s relationship to Burning Man — and to each other. But talk to any artist, and their reasons for making the leap from participant to creator are as varied and intimate as the people themselves. The motivation comes from everywhere, from profound events like the death of a loved one or a midlife transformation, to more organic trajectories of art and self, to simply wanting to give back to the Burning Man community.\n\nNo matter what their origin story is, all the artists start with the same blank slate: the playa. From there, the lessons and learnings come hard and fast. We interviewed six first-time artists — three of whom received Honoraria grants — about their experiences, how they thought about funding, what they would do differently next time, and what really matters when taking this plunge.\n\nWhat follows are insights for any Burning Man-curious artists out there. The advice can be sobering, but everyone we spoke to said they would do it again, felt invigorated by the experience, and proudly embraced their new, hard-earned identity. (While the Honoraria grant process is now closed for 2020, there are other ways to bring art to the playa, including through self- and crowd-funding. You are welcome to register your 2020 piece starting in late February.)\n\nStart Learning From Other Artists Right Away\n\nPam Ward created “The Bard’s Branch” as an ode to two of her favorite things to do as a child: reading books and climbing trees. The piece had over 2,000 second hand books from San Francisco Library deseeding programs and other donations — all of which were arranged into rainbow chakra spirals from base to top. Pam learned what creating big art for the playa was like by joining the crews for “Totem of Confessions” in 2015 and “Black Rock Lighthouse Service” in 2016.\n\n“Having that foundation gives you the confidence to take a leap and go for it,” she says. “Having a community of builders goes a long way.”\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nKeep It Simple\n\nNearly every creator we spoke to underscored how important it is to simplify your vision because costs will creep up, plans will change, and you’ll learn better ways of doing things as you go along.\n\n“The art will take more time, money, people — pretty much more of everything — than you imagine in the beginning. Even tiny art,” says Daria of “Owl’s Nest.”\n\nHone in on What Really Matters\n\nPlotting resources wisely means being clear on what you’re trying to achieve in the first place.\n\n“It’s easy to think of something super complex; it’s a lot harder to put it in action,” says Sharon DeMattia, the force behind “We the People,” an installation featuring 26 humanoid canvases that invited people to draw on them.\n\nSharon shares critical advice she received from one of her collaborators, Jeremy Evans at The Generator, a maker space in Reno, Nevada, where she’s based: “Always remember that 20% of your vision is 100% of what they will see. So do 20% really, really well.” This tip helped her focus her efforts, scale back in places, and reduce her budget.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nKnow Your Fundraising Strategy\n\n“Decide if you’re self-funded or raising funds and stick with it,” says Daria. “We had a bunch of friends who would start as self-funded, realized that it would take much more money and tried to raise some funds later in the process — which takes time and resources, too. If you don’t plan it from the beginning, it usually ends up wasting more time than raising money.”\n\nGet the Word Out\n\nIf you do go the crowd-funding route, Emily Nicolosi of “Koro Loko” recommends doing research to see what’s best for your project (Kickstarter, Hatchfund, GoFundMe, etc.), study which kinds of campaigns do well on your platform of choice, and make a great promotional video, even a DIY one. Then get the word out! Ask friends and family to share on their social channels, send out an email blast, make some phone calls.\n\n“I dressed in a tutu and handed out flowers to raise awareness and money, and it turned into another art project and unexpected gift called ‘The One Face of Love,’” says Sharon of “We the People.”\n\nShe ultimately found the most fundraising success via a fiscal sponsor, meaning she could work in partnership with them as a 501c3 organization.\n\nBuild a Strong Team\n\nLindsay Glatz created “Cloud Swing” as a love letter to the people she most adores. “My first-ever memory is being pushed on a swing by my grandmother, who was the person who most infused creativity and wonder into my life,” she explains. “The other bit came from my husband who is obsessed with clouds.”\n\nBut Lindsay, like all the artists we spoke to, underscored the necessity of working with a strong, dedicated team to make the vision a reality. For example, she collaborated with Will Nemitoff of Curious Form to “dissect the cuteness of clouds and through his expertise the clouds as were able to be realized.”\n\nHer husband and sister did much of the build work in the hot New Orleans summer, and her camp, Yurtnited Nations, was a lifeblood: “They took care of setting up our shelter, shade structures, everything we needed to be comfortable so that we could focus on the art piece.”\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nDon’t Underestimate Scale Out There\n\nImagine going to Black Rock City for the first time and creating massive art. That was David Oliver, who brought “PORTAL” to the desert this year. Comprised of a metal ring 12 feet in diameter and decorated with 4,608 glass tiles in 24 colors, “PORTAL” was held up by two big basalt columns.\n\n“I thought I was building such a huge piece and out there it seemed so small,” he recalls.\n\nNow he’s thinking about designing a piece for 2020 that’s more “playa-oriented.” “I’m going to be playing with perspective a little more,” he says of the art that has the working title of “Mandala.”\n\nThink Through All the Logistics\n\nMaking the art is just the start. If it runs on a generator, it’ll need to be refueled during the Burn. Maybe lights will need to be turned on at dusk and off at dawn. If it won’t be burned, it’ll need to be stored somewhere afterwards. All these things could impact supplies, costs, and the crew’s experience.\n\n“We never really thought that such a tiny object would require shifts two to three times a day, with somebody responsible all the time,” says Daria of “Owl’s Nest.”\n\nDavid of “PORTAL” says next time he’ll budget for help from specialists and not just rely on friends who might get distracted or burned out.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nRead the Handbook, but Expect the Unexpected\n\n“The Burning Man team does an excellent job of providing resources and helping to prep artists,” says Lindsay of “Cloud Swings.” “However, I think the best mantra for Burning Man itself, and creating work on the playa, is to expect the unexpected.”\n\nAs a first-time artist, sometimes you don’t even know the right questions to ask until you’re confronted with them. Plus, dust storms. Wind. Shenanigans.\n\nRemember: You Got This\n\nEmily made the shimmering “Koro Loko” to honor her mother — “the brightest, most loving light in my life” — who had recently passed away. The ambitious project faced daunting engineering challenges, such as how to get a giant heart to balance on a single point and how to get a 3D look with the chosen materials. (They had to tie over 2,000 squares into lines with copper twisted in the back and manually cut each corner off every square. And that’s just the start.)\n\nIn addition to resolving to “think a lot more about the build and set up from the drawing board,” Emily says letting go has a role, too.\n\n“It’s important to remember that sometimes your solution is ‘good enough,’ as our co-creator Steve would say. Also: ‘We got this,’ as our Captain Jon lovingly reminds us. We can do anything together.”\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nKeep That Imposter Syndrome in Check!\n\n“You have this feeling of doubt all the time,” admits Daria, “like ‘I’m not a real artist, what is it that I’m building? Is it even an art or some strange shit? And does anybody really need it?’”\n\nDaria came to realize that she’s not alone on this one and yearned for a way to hear more stories about the creation of art. “It’d help to understand that you’re not the only ‘not real artists’ and other people aren’t super professional and confident either when doing this.”\n\nBut It’s All Worthwhile in the End\n\nIf all this sounds like an emotional rollercoaster, it is. But what makes it worth the ride are the participant reactions. All the artists were moved — sometimes to tears — when observing people experiencing their creations.\n\n“I loved hearing people reading through the gramophone from the armchair to the ground,” recalls Pam Ward.\n\n“A father reading ‘The Little Prince’ to his child…Friends reading spiritual teachings to their new friends. A group of 100 wizards and gamers rocking up on a treasure hunt…Many families and children were at the piece, which always warmed my heart. People brought their art to the piece, a beautiful violin player. So many things!”\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nDavid was bemused by how many participants took selfies with “PORTAL” — at least 50% by his count. And if they didn’t do that, they would put their arms in the air “like they really had experienced something.”\n\nLindsay says: “The ultimate delight was seeing people interact in real life with something that has existed in my head for so many years. It felt like real-life magic…There were so many folks who stepped up to help and encourage us along the way. As they say, ‘the playa provides,’ and that was certainly true of our experience.”\n\nHer own desire to step up and contribute was shared by many of the other artists — and we hope by you too. “I’ve left the playa the last few years with a sense of emptiness and I recognized last year that it was a need to contribute to the Burning Man community on a deeper level. Burning Man is a place where imagination comes to life, ” says Lindsay.\n\nClick on photos for more details\n\nTop photo: Emily Nicolosi and crew build “Koro Loko.” (Photo courtesy of Emily Nicolosi)",
