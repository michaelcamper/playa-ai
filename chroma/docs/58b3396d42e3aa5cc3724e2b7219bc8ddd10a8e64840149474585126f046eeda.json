  "content": "Welcome back all you MOOP maniacs and line sweepers extraordinaire! The Hun here, reporting from Reno where I, along with my 115 Playa Restoration teammates, am sadly scrubbing the last of the playa dust from our various crannies.\n\nYes, the Restoration team has completed their mission, sweeping more of Black Rock City than has ever been done, and giving every last ounce of their legendary stamina to make sure our site is clean, so we can have Burning Man again.\n\nOf course, we won’t know the fate of next year’s event until the BLM inspection in a couple of weeks. Between now and then, I’ll be sending you the final results of MOOP Map Live 2012 — our running record of what those intrepid MOOPers have unearthed from the dust of this year’s festival.\n\nI won’t make you wait any longer, folks. Here are the results of Day 5, in which the MOOP Line marched all the way from 7:00 to 2:00 along the blocks between Foxglove and Columbine.\n\nMOOP Map Legend:\n\nGREEN: GO! GO! GO! The Line Sweep moves quickly because it’s clean. Minimal time and effort spent in this location.\nYELLOW: Caution! The Line Sweep moves at a stop-and-go pace. Moderate time and effort spent in this location.\nRED: Full stop. The Line Sweepers are on their hands and knees. A ton of MOOP. Extensive time and effort in this location.\n\nWell, I can’t say this was a proud day for BRC — but let’s all give a big round of THANK YOUs to the Restoration team, who mooped up a thick yellow streak stretching across practically half of the city between E and F. We love ya, home team!\n\nToday, let’s hear from those of you whose camps scored a GREEN! What was your MOOP prevention strategy? Did you moop daily or in one fell swoop? What made it more fun and less work?\n\nFor those of you who lived in the yellow zone: It happens. We still love ya, and obviously you’re not alone. Next year, go get that GREEN.\n\nFor now, this is The Hun signing off.\n\nPhotos by Vertumnus. MOOP Meter by Ballyhoo Betty!",
