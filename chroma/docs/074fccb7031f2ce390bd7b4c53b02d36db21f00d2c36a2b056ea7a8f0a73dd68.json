Welcome to our LIVE coverage of the event of the year, the thrilling final quarter of Burning Man 2012, the nail-biting conclusion to a rollercoaster season. That’s right: We’re about to start creating this year’s MOOP Map.\n\nIf you’re tuning in for the first time, here’s what you need to know: Burning Man may technically be over, but for the 115 members of the Playa Restoration team, it’s just getting going. These all-star, highly attuned and maniacally dedicated moopers are about to comb the width and breadth of Black Rock City, picking up every last piece of MOOP they can before time runs out. What will they find? Will they finish in time? We’re about to find out.\n\nBut what is MOOP? Why, that’s Matter Out Of Place.\n\nAnd why are we picking it up? Because the Bureau of Land Management allows Burning Man to use the Black Rock Desert on the condition that we Leave No Trace of our event. And because every member of the Playa Restoration team is committed to erasing any remnants of the incredible Burning Man hullabaloo, and returning this desert to a pristine, featureless state.\n\nWhat’s the MOOP Map? It’s a record of the amount of MOOP found by the Restoration team as they pass through every city block, every art site and every square foot of land they can cover before time is up. If you mooped your camp, it’ll be marked green on the map. If you didn’t moop as well as you could have, you’ll be marked yellow or (gasp) red. Here’s 2011’s MOOP Map for reference.\n\nWhy is time running out? The BLM arrives on October 3 to inspect Burning Man’s footprint on this desert — and let me tell you, they’re expecting that footprint to be small. In order to ensure that Burning Man meets the BLM’s strict standards, Playa Restoration must inspect the entire city, foot by foot.\n\nWhy do you put the MOOP on the Map? Because Leaving No Trace isn’t just up to these 115 brave moopers: It’s YOUR job to leave this playa spotless! Playa Restoration is here to tell you how you did. How did you do? Did you moop your camp? The whole world’s about to find out.\n\nOoh can I come join you? Maybe next year, and only if you’re ready to give it your all with the world’s #1, never defeated, all-star mooper team.\n\nRight now, the most important thing you can do is to cheer on your home team, led by the one and only, the fearless, the mighty D.A.\n\nThis year, with Black Rock City bigger than it’s ever been, D.A. recruited a bigger team than this town’s ever seen. For the first time ever, there are over 100 people scouring the playa for MOOP in all its forms. Many of them are hardened veterans, with years of experience and highly specialized skills. Some of them are rookies, wet-eared and eager for the fight. But they’re all out there right now, as I write this, kicking up dust in a joyous fury.\n\nYes! The race is on, and our team will emerge victorious as ever. Will your camp be victorious in your own MOOP efforts? Did you score green, yellow or red? Tune in daily between now and October 4th to find out.\n\nThis is The Hun, signing off.\n\nAll photos by Vertumnus!",
