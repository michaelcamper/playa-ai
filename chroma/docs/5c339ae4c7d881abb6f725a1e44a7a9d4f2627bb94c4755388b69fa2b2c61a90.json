  "content": "Really? At Burning Man, is this even possible? A group of artists building Otic Oasis seem to think so.\n\nOur experimental city provides us many things, but a huge gap in the structure of our temporary home are places for silence. It is rather funny isn’t it. Our city sits in the Black Rock Desert, a 400 square mile expanse of quite literately nothingness and during the week of the festival you’d be hard pressed to find a space of silence.\n\nOtic Oasis is not your usually variety of “death to sound camps” grumpy harrumphing “Burning Man was better back in the day” project. Instead the reason I’m compelled by this project is its understanding of the need for both sound and silence. The creators behind Otic are calling for balance, creating a project that supports and expands the diversity of our city. They see that both environments are needed; the frenetic energy of the art, fire, people and music; and the silent spaces for reflection, grounding and pause.\n\nDescribed as Black Rock City’s first Wilderness Outpost, Otic Oasis will be found deep in the walk-in camping area.\n\nNot only is the concept of Otic Oasis compelling the structure and upcoming build reinforces its gift of silence. It is made completely of interlocking wood, with no nails, glue or metal fasteners. When constructed on the playa the crew will also work within the requirements of the walk-in camping area, all build materials will be hand-carted into the Oasis’ wilderness location, and the structure will be erected without use of any motorized vehicles.\n\nIn past years it has been virtually impossible to find a quiet space to escape the constant pulsing aural landscape and have a peaceful moment to reflect. This year Otic Oasis will provide that place, a much needed “audio antidote” to the cacophony of BRC by providing this “wilderness area.”  To support this self-funded project visit their kickstarter\n\nWe need places like this.",
