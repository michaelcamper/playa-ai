  "content": "The list of 2015 Black Rock City Honorarium art installations — reflecting a total of $1.2 million in art grants awarded through Burning Man Arts — is now live, so you can go peruse the art-chitecture that will adorn our temporary city in just a few months’ time. Some popular playa favorites will be returning, and some new ones will be made. Here are some sights I saw on my first stroll through the list.\n\nThe Bismuth Bivouac, “a playful pavilion celebrating the orthogonal geometries that exist in natural Bismuth crystals.” Have you ever looked at bismuth? It is 100% as gnarly as this installation.\n\nFire Tetris, because Fire Tetris.\n\nThe Life Cube Project, which is graciously returning to Black Rock City after its adventures beyond the playa this year.\n\nIf you’re looking for me, you will probably find me talking to the Lumiphonic Creature Choir between 2:27 a.m. and sunrise every night.\n\nI’m sure every BRC regular is excited to enjoy R-Evolution, the third and final chapter of Marco Cochrane and Deja Solis’ feminine sculptural saga that began with Bliss Dance and Truth is Beauty.\n\nAnd, of course, there’s the majestic Temple of Promise, which just launched its crowd-funding campaign and needs all our help to fill its essential spiritual role in our city.\n\nWell, I’m ready to go. How ’bout you?",
