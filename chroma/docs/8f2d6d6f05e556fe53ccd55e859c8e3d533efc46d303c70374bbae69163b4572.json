Since then, Aeolian Ride (created by artist Jessica Findley) has transformed the landscape of 20 cities around the world with their whimsical kinetic presence. The ride has a magical effect, transforms everyday streets, and creates a loop of joy between the spectator and the riders.\n\nWhat better way is there to celebrate Bike to Work Day than with Aeolian Ride? If you’re in San Ramon on May 14, join the ride at Bishop Ranch!\n\nWhen: May 14, 2014 from 11:30am – 1:30pm\n\nWhere: Bishop Ranch in San Ramon, CA\n\nCost: FREE (There are a limited number of inflatable suits.
