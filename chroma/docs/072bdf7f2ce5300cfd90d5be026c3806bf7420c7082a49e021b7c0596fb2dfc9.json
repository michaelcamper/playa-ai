Take a gander at Ganymede, hang a right at Hyacinth or leg it out to Labyrinth with the 2019 Black Rock City plan, which we’ve just released.\n\nThe City Plan lays out the streets, plazas, center camp, reserved placement camping and walk-in camping for our playa Home each year. Each year’s theme decides the names of the annular streets, and the 2019 Metamorphoses theme has birthed the following names:\n\nWhat else is new in 2019? Terry Schoop, chair of the city planning subcommittee and draftsman of the plan, has got the skinny on the city.\n\n“We’ve added new plazas at 4:30 and 7:30 at Bacchus. We are varying blocks depths between 250’, 200’ and 150’. We are incorporating an increase of 50’ depth to the city over 2018, and we have reduced the size of the Center Camp portal,” he says.\n\nTheme camps also need to take particular note:\n\n“The light blue shaded area approximates where you will find reserved-placement camps: interactive theme camps, camps supporting art installations, and infrastructure camps. We’ve softened the edges of the reserved-placement shading here as this zone fluctuates greatly between this initial city plan and the final placed camp plan displayed at the event site,” Terry says.\n\nTo nerd out on city dimensions and learn more about reserved camping spaces, walk-in camping and parking, head over here.\n\n2019 BRC City Plan\n\nTop photo by Will Roger",
