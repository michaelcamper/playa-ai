  "content": "Want to know what the traffic situation is on Highway 447 or the wait time at the Gate? Beginning Sunday, August 24, we will begin broadcasting hourly traffic reports on BMIR 94.5 at the top of the hour. We’re aggregating real-time traffic information from Nevada Highway Patrol, Nevada Department of Transportation and our eye in the sky (ok, an IP traffic-cam on Poito Peak) to give you up-to-the-minute details on the drive to the event.\n\nBMIR will be streaming via iHeartRadio again this year beginning Aug. 21. You can download the app here, and tune in on your mobile device before entering the communications dead zones north of Wadsworth and south of Cedarville for a no-snark traffic update. Long wait time? Consider sitting tight until the back-up lessens.\n\nWait? You want more? We’ll also be providing real-time traffic updates 24/7 via Twitter. Just follow @BManTraffic.\n\nBMIR will also begin providing Exodus wait times and highway traffic reports on Saturday, Sept. 1 through Tuesday, Sept. 2.",
