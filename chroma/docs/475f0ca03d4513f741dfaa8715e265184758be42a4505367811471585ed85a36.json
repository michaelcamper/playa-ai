That’s right, I’ve got the complete (though not FINAL-final) results for the entire city grid of Burning Man 2015, all mapped for you.\n\nI’ve also got one more person to introduce you to – though there are countless amazing, fascinating people out here working Playa Restoration, I can’t introduce you to each of them. Luckily, miss Auntie Social speaks for many of us.\n\nAuntie Social was the Man Base Stage Manager this year, and has been a member of the DPW since 2009. She does many amazing things in the outside world as well, so I’ll be sharing some of her photos of a truly creative, original life. Get inspired!\n\nAuntie, you’re one of the steady stars of our community. I can’t imagine this place without you, either.\n\nTo all my DPW and Restoration and Burning Man brethren – whatever it is, we found it. And once you find it, you have it forever.\n\nA Map For You\n\nIn the greatness of the universe, our city is but a speck. And in the expanse of the site that was once Black Rock City, nary a speck remains.\n\nPlaya Restoration’s line sweepers had quite the adventure in bringing you this final map. They forded rivers, sloshed through the mud, and even changed their plans to stay an extra couple of days so they could complete the epic task of mooping the city of Black Rock.\n\nResto, we salute you! Black Rock City, we salute you too! Here’s a hurrah for the one-two punch: a city full of people who really did their best to Leave No Trace, and a dedicated crew who did whatever it took to restore the playa.\n\nThis is what it takes to pass the inspection and ensure that Burning Man keeps happening. And so it shall. Onward to 2016.\n\nOne last word: This is NOT the final map. The final is still being created, and will be released in a few months, along with detailed information about what was found where. If you’re wondering about what happened, and you’re a placed camp, you will hear from your Placement representative in a few months with more information. For now, celebrate the close of a truly successful season, despite the odds and the weather, and give your Burning Man representatives a few weeks to breathe. We love ya!",
