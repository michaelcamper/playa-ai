We specifically want to hear from first-time Burners about your experience.\n\nWhat were your impressions going in? How did the reality differ from your expectations? What did you get out of your time on playa? What did you learn? What are you taking home with you?\n\nLeave your thoughts in the comments below. Oh and also: welcome! We’re glad to have you with us!\n\nAnd if you’d like to give specific feedback about the event (good or bad), please email it to feedback@burningman.com before November 1st … that’s our official Feedback Loop channel.",
