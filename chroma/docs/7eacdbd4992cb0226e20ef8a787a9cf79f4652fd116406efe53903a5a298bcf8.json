  "content": "Two tickets arrive fed-ex on time and it’s off to the Playa to play\nSometimes big trucks get all broke down,\nJust ask Triple A Carl, what happens now?\nWe wait.\nReverse the dismay with salame, stale camels and ice cold teqi-lay.\nOnward over mountains, eat burritos, pyramid lake, secret way, sun falls, drive up,\nRing a bell then look and look and look, don’t tell.\n\nIt’s good to know people\nWhen you don’t know camp.\nThe ever gracious muragers saved us naked in their sleep.\nRide on, hop on the pegs and dance\nNo, don’t speak, just go get on your freak,\nYeah, stand up and freak you freaky little freak.\n4:45 I mean 3:45 and Fate, that’s where the boat was docked.\nMan oh man, it sure did rock.\nThen the RV, a vacant tent, and well spent journey found a moment’s end.\nOne hundred minutes of sleep, some rest, press forward,\nNo direction in hand, keep it cruising to find another camp.\nA bus, a stage, blinking lights, fernet,\nSee the pirate’s flag, and welcome home burner friends.\nA large-eyed pupil man once said “Just stop, close your eyes, go to the\nMusic (I smiled) and the magic of this place will light your way.”\nRavers, artists, nudists, ninjas, pirates, criers,\nSpeakers, dreamers (dream on you fucking dreamers), spinners, burners,\nFreakers, sneakers, singers, dancers, floating streakers …\nAnd a whole lot of techno on great big bass-ass speakers.\nThey all will find their way.\nCircle, traverse, reverse, go forth to the light\nLike bug-eyed flies flying high through the night.\nKeep peddling, go fast, go straight, turn left, strip down, scream loud and\nFollow with speed. A dust storm is coming, swift force, pay heed.\nLet’s watch its pace…it travels with grace.\nAnd now it’s time for soup good friends.\nCome watch the day begin to sway.\nThe beer will spew, the fire will spin, the heads will gong\nAnd the music will play all day all day.\nBig boots, bustiers, sharp hats, night lights, furry fur-wear,\nLooking good,\nWait, actually, wait, no wait,\nLooking really fucking awesome great,\nGlitter-up, giddy-up saddle up and shine.\nFlips, drinks, p-funks and smiles, beauty and light come out at night.\nOh floaty boat, take us there, through all the fancy playa fair –\nCherry-picker flowers tower over head,\nKitty cats, lily pads, roller rinks, pirate ships, floating lips, light up whips.\nAnd where is anxious street?\nShow me the way again and again, cause I came here to get lost.\nAnd no, I don’t care, not even a little because it is truly a small cost,\nTo find a universe – an ethereal way, to take you through your daily day,\nMelt away the frost and say:\nIn the desert, a piece of me sure will stay.\nEven back in our land of norm,\nWatch me sing and dance and say\nHip Hip Hooray! Hip Hip Hooray!\nI wanna be in the dust storm!!\nOle, Ole Ole Ole!\n\nby Christine “Gato” Imfeld",
