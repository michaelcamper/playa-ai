  "content": "I was saddened to read on the Tuna Guys Facebook Page:\n\nFew people embodied the Burning Man spirit to me like Captain Jim & The Tuna Guys. I met him my first year on the playa (1998) and have made a point to connect every year since. The only meat I’ve eaten since going vegetarian was tuna caught by Jim & his crew. I am grateful to have been so blessed by his gifts and spirit.\n\nI recorded a tribute to Jim during  my weekly podcast.\n\nRecorded live during Hug Nation, Dec. 13, 2011.\n**NOTE: I AM NOT AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF BURNING MAN. I am merely a Participant with a passion for the event, people, and principles of Burning Man. Half-baked ideas & views expressed aren’t necessarily those of the Burning Man organization.” **",
