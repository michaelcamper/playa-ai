These workshops are intended to further the principles of gifting and radical self-reliance using tools that are readily available. This next workshop in our series is being led by Will Chase, who has extensive experience in social media and fundraising for art projects.\n\nWorkshop Description:\n\nWant to create something awe inspiring — on playa or off — and wondering how to cover the costs? If so, this workshop on fundraising might be just for you! If you want to create a medium- or large-scale art project, you’re likely going to need money to realize your vision … and unless you’re independently wealthy, this will require fundraising of some kind. This workshop will cover fundraising strategies, tips and techniques to help maximize your effort whether you’re looking for help from your immediate community or a broader audience of donors. (Note: this workshop will NOT cover grants or grantwriting. It will instead focus more on on-line crowd-sourcing options and similar direct fundraising efforts.)\n\nParticipate!\n\nJoin us to participate. Not local? No worries! This workshop will be accessible online – please indicate this when you RSVP so we can email you the invitation to the online meeting. Have a question you want to share? Feel free to email it to willchase@burningman.com before the 13th so we can include it.",
