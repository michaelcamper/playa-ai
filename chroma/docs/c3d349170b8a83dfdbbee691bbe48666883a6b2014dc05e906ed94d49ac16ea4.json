  "content": "Black Rock City got a pretty good drenching in the late afternoon on Monday, shutting down all vehicular movement, forcing workers to put down their tools, and generally bringing things to a halt as Burning Man moves toward opening day.\n\nThe weather forecasts were predicting a 30 percent chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon, but weâ€™re used to seeing the rain cells move up and around us. This time, thick dark clouds and heavy winds made a beeline for the city, and the downpour hit hard for about 30 minutes. Hail also pelted the ground for a short period.\n\nThe Point One road was shut, and the call went over the radio to shelter in place, with no driving. Even a little rain turns the wispy playa dust into a sticky, gummy mess that sticks to tires, shoes and anything else that tries to travel over it.\n\nThere were consistent high winds and heavy dust in the wake of the rain, but by 5:30, the skies had brightened and the roads in the city, while still pockmarked with puddles, were beginning to dry out. But Haul Road, from the asphalt of Route 34 to the entrance of the city, still had a good amount of standing water.\n\nThere were no initial reports of significant injury or damage from the wind and rain, although there were some issues reported at the Catacomb of Veils site. A fair number of PortaPotties were knocked over, too.\n\nEarlier in the day, the wind was considerably stronger than it has been in recent days, with frequent whiteouts. Cobra Commander said at the morning meeting that weather forecasters were expecting 40 mph gusts, and the forecasts were correct.\n\nHere are some pics of the wind, the dust and the rain:",
