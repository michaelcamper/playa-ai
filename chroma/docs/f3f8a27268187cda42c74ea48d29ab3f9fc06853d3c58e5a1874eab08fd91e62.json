  "content": "Just a little note to say hello from Burning Man.  We miss you if you are not here.  Thinking of you.  As always there is a lot going on here. BIG art, lots of community and as always heat and dust, although it cooled off a little yesterday which makes me very happy.\n\nAnd a little shout out to the Dust City Diner, we hear it is their last year on the Playa, and they are making the rounds to ensure all of their volunteers and people who have helped support them all these years are getting by to say farewell to them.\n\nAnd here is a small shot of the Man before he burns tomorrow night.",
