  "content": "The past two seasons without Black Rock City have provided Burning Man Project time to reflect and assess. This pause in the event cycle, challenging as it’s been, has been an opportunity to focus our intentions; you will see some of this in our 2022 ticketing strategy. We’re excited to share news of the updated ticket sale design and recalibration, as well as the renaming of some existing programs to better reflect the larger social purpose they serve within the community.\n\nEach year, the ticketing strategy is designed in service of the community as a whole, with each sale and program built for a specific facet of the community. Like the 10 Principles of Burning Man, each sale and program exists in relation to the others, and all work together holistically to support the community ecosystem. It is equal parts practical and aspirational.\n\nWITHOUT FURTHER ADO…\n\nThe Black Rock City 2022 ticket sales cycle will start with the FOMO Sale on February 2, 2022. The FOMO Sale is intended to allow Burners to support the broader community by purchasing tickets at the highest price they are able. These higher-priced tickets support the existence of lower-priced tickets for Burners in need, art grants, and other important programs. You will be able to register for this sale directly in your Burner Profile between January 26-29. The sale will be accessible in your Burner Profile. Two ticket prices will be available in this sale: $1,500 and $2,500.\n\nOur longstanding Low-Income Ticket Program is being renamed the Ticket Aid Program and will continue to provide access to reduced-priced tickets for applicants whose applications demonstrate that their circumstances merit financial assistance and convey their intended engagement in Black Rock City is a meaningful contribution to the community. We are also excited to be increasing the size of this program to offer 5,000 tickets for 2022, an increase of more than 10% from 2019. The goal of the program is to ease the way for those of lesser financial means to bring their unique gifts to the playa, thereby enhancing the richness of BRC’s diversity for all. Full information about the program and process can be found on tickets.burningman.org. The link to the 2022 Ticket Aid Program will be posted on the ticket page beginning March 16, 2022. Tickets will be $225.\n\nIn order to better represent the role of the people for whom the sale is designed, the all-important Directed Group Sale will now be called the Stewards Sale, with tickets priced at $475. Functionally it will not change, but we felt this shift was important to convey that the intention of this sale is not simply to serve groups. Instead, the intention is to facilitate the engagement of many of the most consistently engaged builders and doers who continue to gift their unique creative offerings to all BRC participants.\n\nThe Main Sale will take place in late March and will also have registration through Burner Profiles. Tickets will be $575.\n\nNew for 2022: over the spring and summer, several thousand tickets will be dedicated to Community Action & Initiatives. These tickets are being set aside to support a wide group of amazing people and projects focused on important work in the areas of environmental sustainability and diversifying our community to nourish its vibrance and ensure its continued evolution.\n\nThe full details of all our planned 2022 Black Rock City ticket sales and programs can be found on the official ticket page.\n\nA note to the generous supporters of the future of Burning Man who were able to purchase an Invitation to the Future in 2021: Thank you, and you will be receiving direct communication, in March, with details about how to use your reservations.\n\nDOING BLACK ROCK CITY SAFELY\n\nIt is important for all potential BRC 2022 participants to understand that a valid ticket is not all you will need to access the event. As the community’s safety and wellbeing remain our top priority, everyone working and playing in BRC will be required to undergo a COVID-19 health check process before entering the event site. As of this time, we expect that the health check requirements will be satisfied with proof of either a COVID-19 vaccination or recent negative test results. We will share more information and answer questions about the mechanics of the health check process as we finalize our operations in the coming months. Sign up for the Jackrabbit Speaks and subscribe to the Burning Man Journal to stay up to date.\n\nWATCH OUT FOR SCAMS\n\nBecause it’s been a while since we have all been on this ride together, a friendly reminder: stay vigilant and educate your friends so they don’t fall prey to predatory speculative BRC ticket listings, scalpers, and scams. No tickets have been sold to BRC 2022, so any listings you see on resale sites are 100% speculative, which means the seller does not actually have the tickets they’ve listed for sale. These sellers are looking to exploit and capitalize on the desire of our community to reconvene. Please do not buy tickets from Viagogo, Stubhub, or other anonymous resale sites — they exist solely to take advantage of your desire to return to BRC and line the pockets of the sellers. Another red flag to look for are package deals which include Black Rock City tickets — we never sanction the use of tickets as part of a tour package, so any tickets you may see offered in these circumstances are liable to be canceled for violating our terms. The only tickets that are guaranteed authentic and not marked up above face-value are tickets bought directly from Burning Man Project or our official Secure Ticket Exchange Program (STEP). For a refresher, please revisit this helpful post. If you find yourself with a ticket you no longer need, we encourage you to use STEP to keep that ticket circulating in the community at face-value!\n\nDRATS! WE CAN’T ALL BE IN BRC 2022!\n\nWe know that there are many reasons why you might not make it to Black Rock City this year. Demand for tickets exceeds availability every year, and the logistics of pulling off a week (or more) away from work, family, commitments, etc., introduce other challenges. We also recognize that maybe it’s just not the right year for you to go. Please know you’re not alone! We love you to pieces and are grateful for your participation and support from wherever you are in the world. Even if you’re not in BRC in 2022, you can stay connected and feel the warmth of the Burning Man fire by checking out our guide on how to Burn anywhere and everywhere.\n\nGETTING EXCITED…\n\nWhen we gather again in the dust, it will have been three long years since we were all together. To say we’re excited about going back Home with the Black Rock City community is the understatement of the year. But, we’ll say it: We can’t wait to see your dusty faces again. This extended pause has been tough on so many in the global Burning Man community. But Burners are resilient, and we know that the world needs Burning Man and Black Rock City more than ever. Take care of one another over the next few months, and we’ll see you in August!

The sale will take place on February 2, 2022.\n\nHow do I know if I’m getting Stewards Sale (formerly Directed Group Sale) tickets?\nYour camp or project lead will be contacted by the respective department they interact with (Placement, Art, DMV, etc.).\n\nWhere do I apply for the Ticket Aid Program (formerly Low-Income Ticket Program)?\nThe application will be linked from tickets.burningman.org.\n\nWhen is the Main Sale?\nThe Main Sale will take place on March 30. Registration for the Main Sale is March 23-25. Head to tickets.burningman.org for all 2022 ticket information.\n\nYou’re selling tickets. So…is the event definitely happening?\nOur intention is to produce Black Rock City in 2022. All of our time, energy, and funds are going towards that goal. Check out this post for more information.\n\nYeah but if the event gets canceled, will my ticket purchase be refunded?\nTickets to Black Rock City have always been nonrefundable. That’s because we use ticket revenue to produce the event, and a lot of that spending has to start right around the time ticket sales happen. Your ticket money helps defray the costs of our permits from the government, staffing, equipment maintenance and repair, and more. Income from ticket revenue is what allows us to flip the switch and get cracking on making the event happen. We don’t offer refunds because we would not be able to move forward with our production timelines and hiring if we were not secure in our source of funding.\n\nWhen the pandemic started in 2020 and we were forced to cancel the event, we made an exception to this policy and offered ticket buyers the opportunity to receive a full or partial refund. This was the right thing to do in a unique moment of collective need. The community graciously gave Burning Man Project about $3 million to help us keep the lights on. (THANK YOU AGAIN!) Frankly we couldn’t have done it without the generosity of the community. We marvel every day at how your support is making BRC 2022 happen!\n\nThough we have our sights set on a return to Black Rock City this year, we are still in the midst of an unpredictable pandemic. Should circumstance prevent us from bringing our city back this year, and force us to cancel the event before early May, we intend to make a one-time exception to our “no refunds” policy and offer partial refunds of up to 50% of your ticket purchase. If we have to cancel the event later than early May, we will be unable to make any exception to our policy, as a large amount of our necessary spending will already have taken place.\n\nPlease note that tickets will not be refundable in any amount for any other reason, including if you find yourself unable to attend BRC after you buy a ticket. Rest assured, transferrable tickets can be transferred via the Burning Man Tickets platform directly, or sold back into STEP.\n\nWe want you to know all of this ahead of time so you can make the most informed decisions about your ticket purchases.\n\nI see BRC 2022 tickets available online. Should I buy them? Are they real?\nNo and no. As of this writing, there have been no ticket sales to Black Rock City 2022, and there are therefore no tickets available for you to purchase.\n\nI have a question that wasn’t answered here. Who can I contact?\nEmail ticketsupport@burningman.org if you have further questions about tickets. You can also check out this helpful FAQ.",
