  "content": "We’re playing a little catch-up here, but we wanted you to know about the third step in the big three-step process of playa preparation, a hellish exercise called “intersections.”\n\nYou know how the city roads are laid out – from the Esplanade that rings the city out along twelve concentric streets named for the letters of the alphabet. Those streets are intersected by roads designated by clock points, from 10 o’clock around to 2 o’clock, with 6 o’clock being the center point. You can see a map of the city here.\n\nSo that’s all fine and dandy and neat and tidy, but in order for the grand design of the city to make sense, to be useful, what each of those intersections needs is … signs. And what each of those signs needs is … a stake to put it on. And what each of those stakes needs is … a pounding.\n\nYep, today’s fun task once again involves the torture device known as a stake pounder. And you’re going to need plenty of them, because there are 317 intersections, and each of them gets three or four stakes. Then you throw in the emergency signs that also must be put up and, well, you’ve got a lot of pounding. Again.\n\nBooya and Dylan are the crew team leads, and Just George once again is in a leadership position. And their plans involved a new approach this year, one that threw the maximum number of resources at the task. Instead of letting people who had come together to tackle the fence filter off to separate crews, they kept a large number of them together to do the intersections.\n\n“It’s a marshaling of resources,” George said. “And it’s better for morale because keeping all these kids together builds team spirit. … It’s easier for the Fluffers to support us, too.”\n\nA task that had usually dragged on for at least three days in years past was done in two this year. And George, the former military guy, was once again proud of his troops.\n\n“If I’d have had them when I was in the military, I’d have made general.”\n\nGeorge’s affection and admiration was obvious, but it didn’t prevent him from requiring his people to do some pushups in the dust when everything was finished. That’s the sign of a job well done out here. You get to do pushups.",
