  "content": "I got to bm on Monday night, missed the rainbow, but was just happy to be back home.\nFor some reason, the universe was listening to my my thoughts, to my words and was manifesting it to me. My simplest desires, adventures or requests were achieved.\nI have few examples but to make long story short here goes the best one.\nSaturday after the man burn. I was with a “playa special friend” that I meet on Wednesday, first time burner and he had to leave at 2 am after the man burnt. We were sad that he had to leave and maybe we were not going to see each other on real life ever again, u never know how real world will treat you. We were at Temple of Boom just hanging before he leaves and he said:\n– I have to leave in 2 hours. Lets get lost.\nI said:\n– ok.\nWe started walking, holding hands, kissing and enjoying our last few minutes together, we were going towards the deep playa, it had been a great time together and we didn’t want to finish so soon, but his camp mates had to go and for some reasons he couldn’t stay.\nWe saw a light maybe around 1:30 and H/G, and he said:\n-what is that light?\nI said:\n– I don’t know, let’s check.\nWe walked to the light and did not believe what we saw… the sign saying:\nGET LOST\n\n\nWe had no words to talk. We could not believe what we were seeing.\nWe never hear about this sign before, nobody that was camping with us saw the sign. we did.\nAfter that, he had to leave.\nThe whole manifestation thing was so intense… that now we are together, and we are still getting lost when possible…\n\nby Livia Paz",
