Our community is getting more and more ambitious with its art, its civic engagement, and its placemaking, and these efforts needs strong institutional support. It needs to do the second so as to keep Burning Man culture focused on immediacy, social capital, do-occracy, and the spirit of not having to ask permission.\n\nIt’s going to be difficult, if not a little schizophrenic, to do both of these things equally well at the same time – but I think that’s the essential challenge we face, and the future development of our culture depends on it.\n\nIf that’s all you want to know, you can stop reading now. If you want a more detailed explanation, the rest of this post will give it to you. Don’t say I never gave you anything.\n\n(Ahem)\n\nHow Does Your Culture Grow …\n\nBy my count, there are four eras of Burning Man so far. Danger Ranger has five. I expect that one day we’ll settle this through a prank-off, and I’ll discover that I never really had a brother – it’s been a clever ruse all this time.\n\nBut until then, here’s my shorthand breakdown of Burning Man history:\n\n1986 – 1989: Burning Man was an EXPERIMENT. A small group of friends was trying something, seeing if it worked, discovering what it was, seeing where it went.\n\n1990 – 2003: Burning Man was a FRONTIER. The experiment had been successful, and success led Burning Man to the desert where there were (supposedly) no rules, no regulations, and very little organization to tell anyone to do anything. It was the wild west, in ways both literal and symbolic. When people say “Burning Man has changed,” they’re usually using this era as their baseline – generally ignoring the fact that not only did Burning Man not start out as a frontier, but that the thing most people did with that freedom and license was build community and culture. It’s no accident that the frontier became a city, or that the city became …\n\n2004 – 2013: Burning Man was a CULTURE. Actually, it was probably a culture well before this, but 2004 is when the Regional Network was formed and the 10 Principles written, so it’s a pretty good line of demarcation.   By now Burning Man had more than the freedom of the frontier: it had a star towards which that freedom was pointing. A set of common values, broadly agreed upon. And – this is key – the culture was understood as something you were able to pick up and take with you. As an experiment, “Burning Man” had been synonymous with the Man. Frontier, “Burning Man” had been synonymous with the desert and with Black Rock City. It wasn’t something you could do anyplace else, and if Larry had said “nah, let’s not do this next year” or Black Rock City had been disbanded by the authorities, Burning Man would have been over. When “Burning Man” became a culture, with global reach, that was never possible again. It existed independently of any of its physical vessels, and would grow and evolve in many different places at once. The fact that it grew so successfully is what eventually led us to the current era.\n\n2014 – Present: Burning Man is a HIGH CULTURE. We’ll go into what that means in a minute.\n\nA Crisis is Just a Cliche About An Opportunity You Haven’t Met Yet\n\nNow the important thing to realize here is that each era of Burning Man presented a different set of challenges and a different set of opportunities. The challenges of the experiment at Baker Beach were far, far, different than the challenges of the frontier – and so were the opportunities. No theme camps, mutant vehicles, or larger community was really possible in the experiment, but suddenly they were possible in the frontier. Similarly the challenges of the frontier (survival, shade, food … just finding the damn place … figuring out how to connect with neighbors) were significantly different than those of the culture (figuring out how to “Burn” in other places, explaining what the culture stood for, building a regional network) – and the opportunities were vastly different as well.\n\nWhile it’s easy to point at milestones, these differences aren’t really because any specific person did any specific thing: they emerged as a result of community growth and evolution. Nobody ever specifically said “hey, let’s make the art projects bigger and bigger every year until they’re some of the most massive DIY undertakings in the world” – it just naturally developed as more and more artists and crews gained expertise and renown and exposure to each others’ work; just so, Burning Man evolved from one stage to the next because people showed up, and built art and community around them, and the more they did that, the more physical and cultural infrastructure evolved. And here we are.\n\nAll Roads Lead to Rome\n\nThe characteristics of a high culture include diversity, specialization, abstraction, bureaucratization, reach, and scale … among others. Burning Man, having entered a high culture phase, has to develop them: it’s as essential as developing shade and bringing water were to its frontier period.  If you didn’t bring shelter and water and building supplies to the desert, you simply weren’t going to be able to take advantage of the opportunities the environment was offering you – or meet its challenges.  Just so, if we develop the tools demanded by a high culture, you’re not going to be able to take advantage of hte opportunities the culture environment is offering us, or meet its challenges.  These are the tools that are necessary – and while there are many, many software companies promising “solutions” to the inertia of global teams, no fortress of innovation has yet actually eliminated the need for either meetings or bureaucracy. Whether you’re Google, the Red Cross, or the United Federation of Planets, once you reach that scale, the only option is to build institutional capacity or go home.\n\nWe see these things happening in Burning Man already, in ways that have nothing to do with the Org. The existence of art support camps, for example, are a clear example of specialization: camps that themselves offer no interactive art experience, but instead exist to give essential support to the artist teams who do. Likewise there are more and more theme camps that, of their own accord and without any requirements, are developing increasingly specialized roles (“you manage our social media channels; you handle our MOOP volunteers,” “you make sure our mutant vehicles are in good repair”) as acts of self-creation, in Black Rock City and out in the world.\n\nWhich is to say, the High Culture period is coming whether the The Burning Man Project does something useful about it or not. All those in favor of being helpful raise your hands. So yes, the Project needs to keep up. There’s simply no way to deal with the level of governmental engagement Black Rock City (let alone a global cultural institution) requires without an attendant infrastructure; there’s no way to appropriately handle mass donations, grants, and resources except through an accountable bureaucracy. If the Burning Man Project is to succeed at the opportunities a high culture offers, it has to develop its institutional capacities and bureaucracy.\n\nBlack Rock City is So Not Rome\n\nBut just doing that … or rather, doing only that … will get us something much closer to an “off the rack” high culture (don’t they all claim to value art, self-expression, and communal effort, really, if you ask them?) than it will a specifically Burning Man high culture.\n\nThat’s where the other side of the equation comes in: the Burning Man Project has to develop work-arounds and alternatives to the very bureaucracy it’s setting up, as it sets it up.\n\nIt has to do this because, unlike most global institutions, Burning Man can’t thrive if the people participating are only paying lip service to its culture.\n\nBusinesses don’t need anyone to really believe their “missions” (and it shows) because the bottom line is whether employees do the work and customers buy the product – and they have economic incentives to get people to do at least that much.\n\nGovernments need people to obey their laws – but beyond that, it only matters so much to them whether people are obeying because they believe in their governments or because they are afraid of state power. (Indeed, for many governments, the two are indistinguishable).\n\nArtistic movements generally need to at least engage people – but most of the time, success is measured by critical reception and butts in seats. That is to say, by how well the elite artists get the masses to sit still and watch. (Or shout and watch, or dance and listen … but you get the idea.)\n\nBut not only does Burning Man not have the kinds of economic and legal leverage that other institutions do (especially if you’re outside of Black Rock City), but passive acceptance of the culture represents a failure of the culture on its own terms. We cannot have a do-occracy, a participatory culture based on radical self-expression and communal effort, if people are just spectating. If they’re just going along to get along. Ticket sales and butts in seats do not represent success for Burning Man. Getting whoever shows up, in whatever number, to get off their butts and out of their seats and do something meaningful to them – however pointless – is a sign of success.\n\nWhat does that have to do with bureaucracy? Nothing.\n\nDo it Wrong with the Right Tool\n\nBureaucracy is vital for things like managing massive donations that create the conditions that allow the people to do the thing they’re passionate about. Institutional capacity is crucial for setting up large decision making entities across multiple jurisdictions that deal with things like governments and insurance agencies. These are things that really, really, help. More than that, they allow people to work on a scale and capacity that would otherwise never be possible. (And people in our culture want to do that. They’re all but demanding it.)\n\nBut … when we’re talking about the fundamental experience of do-occracy, the closest most personal response to the 10 Principles … look, no one is ever really inspired to immediacy, inclusion, and self-expression by the need to form a committee to consult on the process of filling out the paperwork. Do-occracy is fundamentally about not asking permission.\n\nI’m not saying bureaucracy is incompatible with Burning Man: at its best – as we want to do it – art-bureaucracy represents what happens when a group of people who know they don’t need to ask permission still voluntarily sublimate themselves towards a greater cause that they could not do on their own. It’s Civic Responsibility, it’s Communal Effort, it’s even Participation … and goddamit, our forms can be funny.\n\nBut even at its best … even as an art-bureaucracy … it demands that people wait and get permission. That’s fine when it’s a burden taken on deliberately. In fact it empowers people who take it on deliberatly, because their patience allows for projects of far greater reach and scope. But for those who aren’t voluntarily sublimating – people who just want to DO THE THING and can’t see any reason not to – it implies exactly the wrong habits of mind.\n\nWe need to develop work-arounds to our own institutional capacity and bureaucracy so that people can still be self-reliant, still express themselves without asking permission, still be inspired by direct contact with all 10 Principles … because that is the only way our culture transmits successfully.\n\nLet’s envision success, naked\n\nWhat does that look like? It’s what we’ve spent 30 years getting good at. Connect people. Give them opportunities. Get out of their way. Welcome them in. Let them build social capital doing what’s meaningful to them.   Ask “how can I help?” Say “yes” unless they’re putting others at significant risk.\n\nExcept it’s not easy, because putting whole big useful systems in place only to encourage people to work around them is fucking hard. It’s one of the hardest things an organizational culture can ever do.\n\nBut it matters that we can distinguish between those things we want to do that a bureaucracy is good at, and those things it’s not – and give people plenty of space in those areas to do and build and play and engage for themselves.\n\nFor the Burning Man Project it’s ultimately a question of confidence and courage: both that our community can fill the space we create when we step back … and that we can be useful enough that they will continue to come, willingly and enthusiastically, to the structures we build even if they don’t have to.\n\nIt’s going to take finesse and courage. For myself, I believe in us.\n\nPhoto of Brickhead EARTH by James Tyler",
