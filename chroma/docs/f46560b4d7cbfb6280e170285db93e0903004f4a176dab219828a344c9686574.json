  "content": "This year, as we have in the past,  the ARTery offers Audio Art Tours for many of the projects that are going up all around us in Black Rock City at this very moment and can be listened to as you wander about the playa. There are over 350 Art Installations for you to enjoy this year so having a description of the art you interact with is essential. Art is appearing everywhere. Be the person in your group who knows something about the art you find while wandering the playa. Get the tour now to have something wonderful to do in line while awaiting entry to Burning Man this year.\n\nThe downloadable Audio Art Tour, put together by Jim Tierney, Kit Kat, Evonne Heyning and Dazzle!, will prepare you for your awesome art-filled playa experience. Download the MP3s and listen to them on your way to BRC!\n\nMore about ART tours on playa can be found here.\n\nTop image: The New ARTery sign, photo by Sydney Erthal",
