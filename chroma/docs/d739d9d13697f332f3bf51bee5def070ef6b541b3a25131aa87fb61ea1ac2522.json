Take a look:\n\nPosting this video is in large part an experiment to see if YouTube will work with this blog. Since it clearly is, please consider this an invitation: make a short video about how to “green the burn,” however you interpret that ( reducing waste, smarter materials, construction, design–you name it!) , send it to environment (at) burningman.com, and we’ll post the best ones here. Thanks!",
