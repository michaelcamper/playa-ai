  "content": "Dear Burning Man community,\n\nHere we are two weeks before the end of the calendar year. Thank you to all of you who have sent words of encouragement, donations, and pledges to participate in Burning Man and bring more joy, awe, art and engagement to the world.\n\nLet me give an update as to where we are so far in our year-end fundraising effort, and what’s in store.\n\nWe started 2024 with a commitment to raise $10M philanthropically. This was up 20% from the $8.2M raised in 2023. Due to the ticket sales shortfall to Black Rock City in 2024, we found ourselves needing to make mission-aligned budget adjustments and raise the remaining deficit to the tune of approximately $10M — this, in addition to the initial $10M goal.\n\nWe cut expenses, reduced the year-round workforce, deferred some payments, got reductions on our office rentals, and doubled down on our commitment to do more to bring Burning Man and Black Rock City to the world, not less.\n\nBurning Man is like nothing else in the world. There is no other mass gathering the size and length of Black Rock City that, driven by Principles including participation, gifting, and inclusion, creates such awe and joy — all without corporate sponsorship, vending and merchandise to subsidize the operation. Much bigger than an event or festival, Burning Man is a global cultural movement that is already benefiting the world.\n\nSo, how do we sustain it, and get more Burning Man out there?\n\nWe have dedicated and passionate donors and supporters. Thank you. With your support, we will continue to lean into what Burning Man Project is:\n\nA global arts and culture nonprofit that needs year-round philanthropic support to accomplish our mission to facilitate and extend Burning Man culture to the world.\n\nThis is the first front of our inflection point: leaning into philanthropy to bring more belonging, connection and creativity to the world.\n\nWe launched a $3M December Community Campaign on Nov. 25. Now, thanks to the generosity of enthusiastic donors, we are able to offer a match to your donations through the end of the year to help us reach our goal. Every dollar donated is worth $2.\n\nThe opposite of shrinking, we are also leaning into our role as a service provider. This is the second front of our inflection point. Burning Man Project is in service to a global cultural movement advancing a more creative, connected and thriving society.\n\nAnd, to be in service to you, the participants that bring Burning Man to life and sustain it 365, we are making it easier to participate in this phenomenon that started on a beach and migrated to the Nevada desert and out into the world. How?\n\nIt is heartwarming and frankly overwhelming at times to hear all of your powerful stories of change and transformation at Burning Man. Most recently, we were thrilled to hear from a major Black Rock City theme camp and art car community that is working to have their group achieve 100% participation in donating to Burning Man Project. Gifts of any amount help us increase our fundraising participation numbers, and when everyone takes part, the benefit Burning Man can have on the world is limitless.\n\nThe world needs more Burning Man — let’s lean in and make it happen together.\n\nMarian Goodell\nCEO, Burning Man Project",
