  "content": "How much do we love the humans who spent months co-creating this summer’s Virtual Burn? A whole heck of a lot. Since last year’s Multiverse, devoted teams of independent technologists have been deep in code, pixels, and social engineering, building six wholly unique virtual experiences that will welcome virtual Burners from around the globe August 22 through September 7, 2021. And yes — YOU are invited.\n\nEach world is building on the remarkable adventures shared last year — co-creating new and highly imaginative ways to explore what it means to be a virtual Burner.\n\nBefore You Meet the Worlds, a Little History\n\nBack in 1990 when Burners first found themselves in the Black Rock Desert, there was a lot to learn. Was it fun? Oh yeah. Was it weird? Yes indeed. Did that foray into the Great Unknown kick off a new creative culture? Seems likely.\n\nSimilarly, 2020’s Multiverse saw the global Burning Man community embark on a new, exploratory and creative adventure into the virtual realm. In 2020, more than 165,000 people came to play. They brought theme camps and art, produced events, shared stories around burn barrels, danced until dawn, and embarked on unpredictable deep playa excursions. Sound familiar?\n\nIt was rough around the edges, and it was experimental. We like it that way. We’re not seeking a shiny corporate experience; we’re helping digital creators imagine and build speculative new community spaces and experiences.\n\nAs with any Burn Week, the minute you strike camp, you start imagining what you’re going to build next. It’s how we got here, and why hundreds of thousands of Burners around the world actively co-create Burning Man events and culture, year after year.\n\nImagine the awesome potential of building radically inclusive virtual spaces that exist beyond time and space, that operate in alignment with the 10 Principles, and that permit large-scale acts of creativity that are not constrained by the laws of physics. Now invite the world.\n\nMeet the Six Worlds of the 2021 Virtual Burn\n\nSparkleVerse\n\nSparkleVerse is a magical online city accessible from desktop computers. Our digital playa is a 2D browser-based map with social features where you can wander through art, music, and experiences co-created by participants. To participate in SparkleVerse you need an internet connection, browser, headphones, and Zoom.\n\nGet Your Ticket Here.\n\nBuild-A-Burn\n\nUnleash your creativity! Build-A-Burn is a network of browser-based virtual worlds with spatial video chat. Burners can freely explore the camp metaverse for moments of spontaneity and serendipity. It’s incredibly easy to co-create a camp, add art, and customize everything with their tools and growing art library — anyone can easily create a unique experience to delight fellow Burners. To participate in Build-A-Burn you need a computer or mobile device, an internet connection, and a browser.\n\nGet Your Ticket Here.\n\nBurn Week Global Live Stream\n\nParticipate in an around-the-world live stream of artists and change makers — or livestream yourself! The FREE GA pass allows you to view daily live streams, the Man Burn and Temple Burn in an interactive environment. The Extended Experience pass includes all of the above, plus you can rewatch the broadcast for 30 days after the event, and have watch parties with friends.
