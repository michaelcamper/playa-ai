  "content": "Hey there sports fans, MOOP maniacs and line sweepers extraordinaire! The Hun here, reporting from Gerlach where our brave DPW Playa Restoration team is really starting to feel the burn. Burning sun, that is — over 100 degrees of it, beating down on the barren desert.\n\nYes, Day Four was a tough one for your Black Rock City home team. The sun rose all red and yellow, and so did the city blocks. Our MOOP line was held up by huge messes in the 2:00 zone — and when they prayed for a cool breeze, they only got biting flies. The insects were so thick that the Restoration team could barely stop to rest — and so they pressed on, making their way through 21 blocks. A very respectable gain by what may be the strongest team this playa has ever known.\n\nDespite the many challenges our team faced, today’s score isn’t so bad. Take a look:\n\nHere’s the report from D.A., DPW Playa Restoration manager:\n\nThe surprise winners today: The entire stretch of Esplanade from 2:00 to 5:00, a solid wall of Green that put all those Red camps to shame! Great job Esplanade theme camps!\n\nThe trouble spots were few, but they were concentrated. Here’s what we found:\n\n2:00 and Esplanade (open playa corner): General MOOP, plus metal construction hardware\n\n2:00 to 2:30 between B and C: A disaster of wood chips on the C side. B side was just MOOPy: Broken glass, cinders, tent stakes, a burn scar, grass sod and bamboo.\n\n2:30 and C: Wood chips, screws, zipties, rebar, cigarette butts\n\n2:45 and B: Just generally MOOPy!\n\n3:00 plaza: An exploded disco ball. Art car accident perhaps?\n\n4:50 between B and C: Pistachio shells, wood chips, PVC shavings, cinders\n\nToday’s overall score: 88% green, 16% yellow and 6% red. That’s a very respectable score, especially considering how concentrated all the MOOPy areas were.\n\nVIDEO: The Great MOOP March!\n\nEver wonder what the MOOP Line Sweep looks like, and how it really works? This video tribute to our beloved DPW Playa Restoration Line Sweepers might just inspire you to form your own MOOP line next year. Watch and learn!\n\nTune in next time to see what happens when the line has to leave a “hot spot” behind. ‘Til then, this is The Hun signing off.",
