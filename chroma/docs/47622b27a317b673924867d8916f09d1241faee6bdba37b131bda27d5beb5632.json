  "content": "My excitement about this year’s Burn went from a three out of 10 to a seven out of 10 in the last 24 hours. I have been diving into the Multiverse and enjoying in deeper ways than I expected.\n\nI believe you can get dust inside you in these virtual worlds. Thank you to the incredible people putting in heroic efforts into building these worlds, and into thinking in ways that have never been thought before. Everyone is a virgin at the virtual Burn. How exciting is that?\n\nLet’s go of what it shouldn’t be. Let’s let go of what we should be. And let’s remember to learn what The 10 Principles have to teach us. I look forward to seeing you online or in person!",
