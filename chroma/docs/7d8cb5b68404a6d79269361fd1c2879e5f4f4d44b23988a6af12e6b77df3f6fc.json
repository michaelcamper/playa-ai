  "content": "I attended the 1st Coachella Music Festival in 1999. (One year after my 1st Burn.)  But I wonder, “would I still feel welcome there?”  Not sure if my perception is accurate, but the stereotype of judgmental Instagram fashionistas and Kardashian-studded VIP areas proves a good contrast to the Radical Inclusion vibe we try to cultivate at Burning Man.\n\nAt Burning Man, we welcome the Stranger.\n\nBut it goes deeper than that. There is another type of Radical Inclusion that is illustrated by a new art project, “Stair Ramps to Heaven.”  Not all Playa experiences should be tailored so that *everyone* can experience them. However, when possible, it is a nice exercise to ask, “Could this art be enhanced to make it available to more people?”  Creating ramp access for mutant vehicles is a perfect example of that.  (So is including captions in videos, as seen above)\n\nIn this video I get deeper into both these types of Radical Inclusion and invite everyone to share ways we can be more Radically Inclusive.  (Full txt transcript here.)\n\nI am not an employee of Burning Man. Just an enthusiastic Participant, like you. Check out all of my Tips & Tricks videos like\n\nRadical Inclusion: From Jesus to Jedi’s to Juggalos",
