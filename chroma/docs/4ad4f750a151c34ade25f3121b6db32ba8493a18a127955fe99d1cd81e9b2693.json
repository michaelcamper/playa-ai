  "content": "A series from the BRC Operations team about what our desert city can become and how we are preparing for the future. Read all the posts here.\n\nPast: How we got here — the Burning Man Bus\n\nBurning Man is like a bus on a never ending route. Over the years, our “Burning Man Bus” has grown and it has never stopped moving. Each season, new luggage gets added to its roof and the load gets heavier. Our route to and from Black Rock City includes no time for pit stops; there are too many things to do in the short yearly cycle of BRC Operations to make big changes. As a result, processes get overloaded and cemented in place, and our ever-expanding bus becomes increasingly sluggish.\n\nBut this year, BANG!, our bus was forced to a screeching halt.\n\nFor the first time in over 30 years, BRC is not being built in the Black Rock Desert. This rare pause in our routine has provided us with an amazing opportunity to look at our bus, re-examine our work and operations, and unpack some luggage.\n\nWhat have we found? An old event, with old systems, made for and by the old world; it’s time for us to make some changes.\n\nOur bus needs some detailing, an oil check, and maybe its tires rotated. It was great when it was designed, and fit perfectly at the time, but the state of the world in 2020, combined with some older systems, are giving us a beautiful opportunity to rethink and reshape.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWe are asking ourselves and our community, when BRC comes back what can it be? There are many opinions about this and the answer can only be found in the collective engagement of our community.\n\nWe agree that BRC should showcase our best selves. Our city has always been a platform for progessive thinking, research, and development. Now is the time for us to expand and deepen our conversations, and do the work that we truly believe in for BRC and the world.\n\nPresent: Three themes & many areas of work\n\nOver the last few months, we have been compiling comments from a wide range of staff and volunteers, listening to participants, reviewing feedback from the 2019 event, speaking with professionals in our field, and staying educated on world developments. From this, we have identified potential operational improvements and built a narrative around 3 major themes:\n\nWe have been able to incorporate, ask questions about, and focus on an array of work areas within our BRC Operations including:\n\nFuture: How are we planning for it?\n\nWe are mapping out the numerous opportunities for the next iteration of BRC, analyzing their feasibilities, and determining:\n\nPiecing together all of these thoughts in order to get us to the next Black Rock City, while factoring in the potential impacts of COVID-19, is complicated and will require the engagement of our entire staff and global community. This work is important and this opportunity once in a lifetime (we hope!).\n\nAs we stand on the side of the road, looking at our Burning Man Bus and discussing the many parts of our past, present, and future, we are excited.\n\nThe possibilities of this moment are great. This is our time to make positive, real, and enduring change to the event we love and for a world that will never be the same.\n\nWe hope this overview has been useful and look forward to continuing our conversation as we further explore the above mentioned topics in future posts.\n\nNext up: Post II — BRC Ops and Sustainability\n\nTop image: Photo by Scott London, design by Tanner Boeger",
