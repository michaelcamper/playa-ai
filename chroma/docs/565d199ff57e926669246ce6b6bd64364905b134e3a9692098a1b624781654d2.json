With a theme like ANIMALIA, I can’t wait to see what wild creativity flows.\n\nJump to the end of this post for design specs, submission guidelines and the deadline (spoiler: it’s May 12, 2023).\n\nEvery year we print many different sticker designs, and typically over a dozen submissions find their way to the playa. Last year we printed even more due to the many amazing submissions! That’s right, we aren’t sitting over here behind our laptops designing a bunch of weird stickers — YOUR lovely brains are in charge. We just print a ton of them and magically transport them to the playa… and hopefully into your hands (and onto your stuff). So if you’ve ever wanted to see one of your own designs on a BRC sticker, this is the moment. Live it!\n\nThink your style is a little wacky? Fear not. We like variety! Get weird. Bring that snark. Tap into that inner child and get playful. Indulge your love of symmetry. Truly, create whatever your heart desires.\n\nFeel free to submit a couple different designs. Don’t forget, there is a theme (hint: it’s ANIMALIA); if a sticker has at least something to do with our animal friends, it’s more likely to get printed. Want to improve your chances even more?  Submit a square design, since most submissions we receive are circles.\n\nOne more thing! Before you submit a design, please read through the requirements below. No custom shapes. No low-res JPGs. And if the type isn’t outlined, our laptops turn your font into something like Comic Sans or Marker Felt (the horror!).\n\nBlack Rock City 2023 Sticker Design Specs\n\n1. Design(s) will need to be one of these die sizes:\n\n2. You must OUTLINE all fonts, meaning vector text is no longer a font but rather it is vector shapes. This eliminates issues for us and the printer not having the font, which is a dealbreaker.\n\n3. If using one to three colors, set up the file to print as PMS. If using four or more colors, set up the file to print as CMYK.\n\nDesigner Tips\n\nSubmitting Your Art\n\nSticker Art Submission Deadline:\n\nWednesday, May 12, 2023. No art can be accepted after this date!\n\nP.S. Did you read the specs? If you send the wrong file type, color settings, or dimensions, we won’t be able to consider your design. And we don’t want that. So double check, then triple check. Is it vector? Is the text outlined? Yes? Then send it on over!",
