  "content": "It began with the first day of sales with “Ticket-tastrophy.”\nAnd most recently we had “The Great Sell Out.” (If I’ve learned anything from “Carmageddon” it’s that inciting panic requires a catchy name.)\n\nYep, the rites of passage began long before we started packing this year. And just like a crazy dust storm, each of these challenges tests us and teaches us.\n\nIn these videos I address some of the fear and anger swirling around as well as highlight some of the lessons to be found in all this.\n\n“Burning Man ‘News'” – Aug. 2, 2011\n\n“Sellouts, Scalpers, & Surrender” July 26, 2011\n\nAs mentioned in the 1st video, it is important to resist the urge to focus on just the negative stories. The news wants to focus on the scalpers. But there are also amazing Burners who are selling their tickets at face value…even though the market value is much higher. Why? Because their values are more important than their wallets. THAT IS AWESOME. We will survive this social dust storm just fine.\n\nThese views are solely the views of Halcyon and do not represent the opinions of The Burning Man Organization or Major League Baseball.",
