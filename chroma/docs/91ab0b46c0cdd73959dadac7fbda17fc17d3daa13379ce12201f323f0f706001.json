  "content": "Burning Man’s 11th Global Leadership Conference begins in Oakland on Thursday, with over 630 Regional Contacts and community leaders converging from around the globe to swap skills, shoot the shit, and share the successes and challenges of their events, projects and communities.\n\nKnowledge exchange is the name of the game at this annual conference. But at this year’s gig, participants will also dig a little deeper into their cultural DNA and explore the juicy realm of politics, picket lines and the role Burners play in times of social upheaval.\n\nThe 2017 conference theme, Sparking a New Citizenship, was chosen with current political climes in mind. It is designed to inspire questions and discussions about our responsibilities as citizens in temporary art-cities, and how and when we apply them to our homes, neighborhoods, cities, countries and planet.\n\n“We are in times of great change politically, but it’s also nothing new that Burners of all persuasions have applied the skills they have learned at Burning Man to taking action. So the theme will unpack that a little bit: how it works and how it doesn’t,” says Stuart Mangrum, Burning Man’s Education Director and one of the GLC’s content curators.\n\nThe theme will also test a long-held — and at times touchy — tension between Burning Man’s resistance to becoming politicized and what some see as a clarion call to put our principles into action and rise to the challenges of these uncertain times. Such tension and resistance have varied across the Burner world, but have been particularly tricky for the organization.\n\n“The tension is that politics is inherently divisive. One of our core principles is Radical Inclusion, so how do we reconcile that desire to change the world you live in with the necessity of taking sides sometimes, and alienating people who might be allies?” says Stuart.\n\nBut Stuart believes the time has come to tackle the conversation. A cross-section of speakers from the Burnerverse and outside organizations will approach the citizenship theme from across the engagement spectrum: from the most basic kinds of neighborhood civic involvement through to overt political activism on national or global levels.\n\nSome of these plenaries and workshops will include:\n\nWe will follow more of these conversations as they unfold during the conference, so stay tuned for further blog posts. Wanna hear some of those conversations yourself? We’ll hook you up with podcasts and videos of some sessions, which will be available online.",
