  "content": "Burners bring everything to Black Rock City.  Massive sculptures, mutant vehicles, dance parties – and big ideas.\n\nFor the past five years, the premier on-playa event for Burner academics and people who love finding knowledge in the dust has been the Burning Nerds Cocktail Party and (Un)Conference.  If that sounds like your idea of a good time, then you’re invited.\n\nWanna come?\n\nWHERE:  Ashram Galactica (6:00 and Guild)\nWHEN:  Thursday, Sept. 1, 3  – 5\nWHAT:  Have a cocktail, grab a microphone, talk NERD!\n\nBig glasses are not required, though they really make you look smart, and smart is sexy.\n\nIf you’re the kind of nerd who likes to help?  Bring food, bring alcohol, or show up at 2:30 and say “I’d like to volunteer!”  They love that.  And you’ll get to meet EVEN MORE PEOPLE!\n\nYou can also join the Burning Nerds mailing list here.\n\nIf you want MORE BRAINS!  MORE! Then have you met the Census Team?  The Census Team is your best friend.  I won’t say they love you … that’s moving a little fast … but they have set up a series of Data Bash events.  Check these out:\n\nIf that’s your kind of party, then we’re your people, and you should show up and develop a whole new model for raising the roof.\n\nSee you in the dust.\n\n(Photo Credit:  Flaming Lotus Girls)",
