  "content": "A few weeks ago we went to a birthday party out on Treasure Island for our friend Lloyd Taylor.  The best part, aside from singing happy birthday and having cake and getting to know new friends was being in a working studio.  Lloyd is the Production Manager.\n\nThey are building “Bliss Dance”, and she is Marco Cochrane’s 40 foot tall vision.\n\nAs you can see from the photos here the statue is huge and beautiful.  40 feet is a lot of woman.\n\nThe goal is to bring Bliss Dance to [BM] 2010.  They have applied for an Art Grant and are waiting to hear the results of their application.\n\nThey have a great web site that has a fabulous gallery of photos of what is currently going on.  And on the best days, the web cam is working, so wander over and check it out\n\n.\n\nLast week Lloyd sent a note that said “With the arms and left leg mostly complete, we start the left upper torso this week. Soon we will be attaching some mesh skin and testing lighting. So come visit us at Bliss Dance on Treasure Island, help if you can or just chill in the great space with killer views.”\n\nTo contact them Click on 07 Project Links, and contact them on Facebook",
