  "content": "On Sunday night, it was time to attach the wads of paraffin-soaked burlap to the innards of the Man, the better for the bonfire that is now less than two weeks away.\n\nIt’s a simple process, but a time-consuming one. You make a fire and suspend a big vat over it. Then you dump big chunks of  wax into the vat and wait for it to melt. Crimson Rose was stirring the strong-smelling stew with long metal tongs, as she has done for years now.  When the wax is sufficiently liquified, you dip rolled-up bags of burlap into the molten mass, which, appropriately enough, is crimson.\n\nThe pieces of burlap float in the blood-colored liquid until they are drenched, and then they are placed on a tarp to cool. Once they can be handled, the volunteers who’ve showed up on this chilly desert night attach them to the slats of the Man with metal wire.\n\n“Maybe we should soak the burlap in bacon,” Rose was heard to say. “Then all the vegans would say, ‘I’m hungry!’ “\n\nIf you wanted to help, you needed heavy gloves and a good set of wire snips. The Man was flat on his back, and SF Slim pointed out that you have to remember to attach the bags in such a way that they don’t slide down when he is raised upright.\n\nIt’s not the most fun job you’ll ever have, but it has to get done if the Man is going to burn, and everyone wants the Man to burn.\n\nThe Man will sport something of a new look this year, which qualifies as news because, by all outward signs, he looks pretty much the same from year to year. He’s the most recognizable icon of the city, a thing of permanence at the event that celebrates temporality.\n\nThe strips of wood on his exterior were being covered with silvery tape, which Sunday night was being referred to as Tijuana Chrome. He’ll look all sleek and Deco, in the Metropolis theme, and the silver will make the neon will glow even brighter.\n\nSmoke Daddy is the person who does the neon for the Man, and he’ll use more neon than ever this year.\n\n“Normally, we use between 100 and 126 pieces on him,” Smoke Daddy was saying. “I don’t know why the number changes, because he’s the same every year. … But this year we got a little more freedom, and we’ll use 215.” So get ready for some extra glow.\n\nThe colors are Neo Blue and Pumped Red (which is really pink, Smoke Daddy said), plus Emerald Green with aqua accents. “It’s like he’s dating an architect from South Beach Miami,” Smoke Daddy said. The Man will also sport cuffs and spats of neon.\n\nThere are things about the Man you may not have known. For instance, he has a heart. It’s a wooden heart, granted, but it’s signed by all the people who helped make him. You can’t see it from the ground, and really, no one knows it’s there but the crew, but it’s important.\n\nYou also might want to look more closely at the Man’s “ornament”  too, the decorative girdle between his legs and rib bones. There will be some fancy silver there, in the Deco-ish theme. “We had to be careful with that,” Slim said, “because we didn’t want to make him ‘boner man.’ “ They also didn’t want to make him look like he had just won a WWF championship belt, either. The solution amplifies the Deco look, and is a little reminiscent of an old time movie house exterior. Check it out.\n\nWhen the burlap soaking was winding down, we wandered over to Jub Jub, the Man Base crew’s camp with the glowing neon monkey overhead. There was a friendly burn barrel to take off the chill. It was Sunday night and time to wind down, because the 7 am meeting would come early.\n\n———\n\nMy burner bike has made it to the playa for 7 years running, and she’s never let me down. But I haven’t done much to repay her loyal service, and this year the bill for my inattention came due.\n\nTravis runs the bike shop on the playa that will offer free help if you run into trouble while you are out here. On Sunday night, he and his crew were kind enough to offer their services to the people who’ve been working on the build.\n\nSo I rolled my bike in. The front tire was close to flat, even though I had filled it with air just before arriving here. The flat was the most pressing need. The fact that it didn’t shift so well, and that the chain was funky with dust and rust … well, I had sprayed it with lubricant and hoped for the best.\n\nJamie Bond, one of the crew, took a look at the bike, and her face was pained, although all she said was that the bike was in rough shape. I felt guilty, but there was no lecture, just a willingness to help, which honestly is the way things go out here.\n\nThis is Jamie’s first burn. She works at a bike shop at the base of Potrero Hill, on the Bayshore side, in San Francisco. You won’t be able to find the shop, because it gets all of its business through word of mouth, and right now they have more work than they can handle.\n\nJamie’s a member of the Bay Area Derailleurs, a bicycle dance team in the city, and also of the Sun Tour Preservation Society, which is devoted to the makers of high quality bicycle parts, a firm so devoted to quality above all else that they went out of business.\n\nIn a half hour or so, Jamie had done “a Frankenstein job” on the chain, the gears were working, and the bike was happy. So was I.",
