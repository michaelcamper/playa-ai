  "content": "Isaac Asimov made some very interesting thought experiments about Artificial Intelligence and the world it creates in I, Robot.  But thought experiments aren’t predictions, and what’s most noticeable about the book now, 68 years after its first publication, is just how little relevance it has to our current dilemmas about AI and automation.\n\nIn Asimov’s collection of stories, the technology for AI (“Positronic Brains”) is restricted – that is to say, only one company actually knows how to make them, and it’s such a fiendishly complicated procedure that no one else in the world (literally) has been able to hack or reverse engineer the process. So one group of people with a clear hierarchy are responsible for the entirety of how AI is programmed and enters the world.\n\nAs a result, AI in Asimov’s stories is centralized: there are clear decision making protocols around how things are programmed, and standards can be decided, enforced, and people held accountable. It’s easy to hold people accountable in Asimov’s stories, because there’s a single world government with legal authority and common laws – it’s not just AI that’s centralized, it’s the whole world.\n\nBut even if it weren’t, AI would still be easy to keep an eye on. To make a positronic brain in I, Robot requires a process far more like a massive car factory with a 5,000 part assembly line than it does a coder working alone in a coffee shop or at a hacker space with a bunch of friends. Artificial Intelligence in Asimov’s imagination is industrial, and takes up space accordingly.\n\nAsimov’s vision of a tech company doesn’t offer free products to its users in order to get information about them, it sells them products that are designed to meet their needs as much as possible and for nothing to go wrong. This is in no small part because such industrial corporations can be easily regulated: the company in I, Robot lives in constant fear that the earth government will add greater restrictions on its products, even forbidding them from being sold on or off-world (depending on the story). There’s no mention or thought of a military-industrial complex, and if this company even has a lobbyist it’s never mentioned.\n\nIt is because of all these conditions – AI as restricted, centralized, industrial, and easily regulated – that the universal adoption of Asimov’s famous “Three Laws of Robotics” are possible. The very idea of someone else coming along and programming robots without them is unthinkable – the one time in these stories that the laws are even tweaked, it’s a massive scandal requiring a joint corporate/military cover-up at the highest levels. And it is those laws of robotics that keep AI’s and robots from turning on the human race, or doing it significant harm.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the premises Asimov based his stories on are true. In fact, the technology has gone exactly the other way.\n\nFar from being a restricted technology, AI is ubiquitous – every industry uses it, a whole lot of code is freely available online, and individual programmers on a beach or in a hacker house can design them about as well as top funded research labs. This means that in the real world, AI is decentralized – and being decentralized makes it nearly impossible to regulate. So far there is no combination of companies, governments, or civic groups that can control where the technology goes next. Somebody – anybody – can always decide to build their code like a mad scientist. They might even get first round funding for it.\n\nTech companies today bear little resemblance to the massive industrial conglomerates of Asimov’s imagination. AI in our world is portable and abstract: it isn’t best symbolized by heavy machinery but by intangible symbols. And where the positronic brains of I, Robot clearly serve human beings, the real AI of the 21st century exist to harvest our information and use it to market to us – activities that might not even be allowable under the Three Laws of Robotics. Your AIs can’t be said to be looking out for you if they’re also spying on you for profit, can they?\n\nWe have therefore reached a point where the most famous thought experiment in managing AI safely for human beings has been rendered impossible by the actual conditions in which AI exist.\n\nIt’s difficult to see how there could ever be universal “laws of robotics” under the conditions we now live in. The thought experiments Asimov conducts through fiction are therefore clever, but not really relevant. Far from regulating AI, we are much closer to AI regulating us. Far from having a clear set of parameters in which AI will operate, it’s the wild west for programming – and very likely that whatever can be programmed will be programmed.\n\nThere is one prediction Asimov made that is shared by the most fervent proponents of AI today: that it will save us. The final story in I, Robot concerns the way in which thinking machines, having been given control over all the world’s industrial output, will start to make decision in our own interests without our own consent – and that it will (likely) lead to a golden age. This is exactly the prediction made by proponents of the Singularity and technophiles who believe that we’ll be better off once we can turn decision making over to the thinking machines that are just around the corner.\n\nBut the lesson of Asimov to our era is the way he was wrong. It turns out, in the world of I, Robot, that humans did all the hard work first by making a world in which the artificial could be applied intelligently.\n\nCover photo by Scott Stallard",
