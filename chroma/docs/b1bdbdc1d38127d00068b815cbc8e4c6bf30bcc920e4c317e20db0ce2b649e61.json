  "content": "~ Leaving No Trace ~\nThe Burning Man community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.\n\nDear Black Rock City:\n\nNormally today I would write a blog post about how we can all continue to do better at Leaving No Trace on the playa.\n\nInstead, it is my great pleasure to tell you that we have passed a new milestone, reached a new high water mark, accomplished a feat never before seen in the history of Burning Man: An almost entirely GREEN Esplanade.\n\nWe’re not posting details of what was found in each spot. If you are a theme camp, your Placement representative may have more detailed information for you in a few months (when the entire Moop Map is finalized). Please be patient: we have much more work to do before we can pass detailed information along.\n\nThat beautiful, moop-free Esplanade is a testament to the hard work and dedication of Esplanade camps, and the Burners who donate their spare time and money, year after year, to bring the party to Black Rock City’s main drag. In so many ways, the Esplanade embodies the best of what Burning Man can be, in all ten principles. With the amount of traffic these camps receive, the infrastructure they build, the stunts they pull off — it’s incredible that they have also succeeded so admirably in Leaving No Trace.\n\nThis is also a testament to all of us who take care to control our moop and leave things better than we found them, even in the maelstrom of Esplanade in all its sound and fury.\n\nPeople of Black Rock City, let’s have a BIG round of applause for the camps of the Esplanade, and for everyone who helped them Leave No Trace in 2014. And let’s learn from this success. If the Esplanade can do it, so can every camp on the playa.\n\nHip hip!\n\nSupport Esplanade LNT in 2015\n\nThe Playa Restoration crew loves to celebrate Black Rock City’s ongoing efforts to Leave No Trace. Each year, we meet one afternoon at 2:00, and moop our way along the entire Esplanade to 10:00. The catch: We stop at every bar on the way.\n\nThe moop marathon is our show of love for Burning Man. Want to participate? Create your own moop march!\n\nStay tuned for more, as the moop line marches through the streets of BRC. We’ll keep posting the results just as quickly as we can compile them.\n\nWant more photos & goodies from the Playa Restoration team? Search #BM2014.
