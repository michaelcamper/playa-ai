  "content": "And now for some ticket news. At this point, ALL tickets have been mailed out to those who purchased them — or they’re being tucked safely away at Will Call, if that’s what you specified. (If you have not received your tickets and are expecting them, contact our ticket support folks for help.)\n\nThanks to the fact that the BLM increased our population cap to 60,900 this year, we’ve got one more limited open sale of 1,000 tickets coming up this Friday August 3 at 12 noon PST. You must sign up beforehand to have access to the limited sale, and you can ONLY sign up during a twelve hour window on August 1 from 10am to 10pm PST — that’s TOMORROW– so, get ready! These tickets are non-transferrable, Will Call only, and yes, they will go FAST. More information and sign up on our tickets page.\n\nWe’ve also been monitoring third-party ticketing websites since tickets first went on sale this year, and we’re happy to report that the number of tickets being sold at inflated prices is quite low. The running average of tickets showing up on these sites vs. the total number in circulation has hovered around 1%, which is extraordinarily low for events of this scale. Happily, the fears of “all the tickets went to scalpers!” appear to be unfounded. We’ve also been actively tracking down individual scalpers and canceling their tickets when we’re able to. A list of canceled ticket numbers can be found here. (As much as we’d love to stop third-party ticketing sites from selling our tickets at all, we simply don’t have the power to do that.)\n\nAs the event nears, we’re likely to see a small increase in the scalper market, however, we’re doing everything we can to prevent inflated sale prices on tickets. One of the reasons we are selling these additional tickets now (in addition to the 1,000 that went into the STEP program on July 8th) is to put a damper on the scalper market by infusing more tickets into the marketplace. While we’re doing everything we can, we also need your help thwarting scalpers. Ultimately, it’s up to YOU not to buy or sell a ticket for more than face value.\n\nWe’re also happy to report that the Secure Ticket Exchange Program (STEP) has been working wonderfully. Most folks who registered for STEP have had tickets made available to them, or will before all is said and done. A note on STEP: the last day to sell a ticket into STEP is August 7th, after which there will be a 72-hour window for folks still waiting to receive access to tickets and purchase them. Thanks to everybody who’s been using STEP to sell back your extra tickets!\n\nYes, it’s been a wild ride for tickets this year (to say the least!). The bottom line is that there are more people that want to attend Burning Man than our population limit allows – it’s a simple issue of capacity.  So no matter how tickets are sold, somebody’s going to get left out. But we’re doing our best to get tickets into the hands of those that want them. We hope that you got yours.",
