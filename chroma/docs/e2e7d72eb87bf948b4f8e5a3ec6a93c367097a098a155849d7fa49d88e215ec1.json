I am thinking of all of you that did not get to come for whatever reason, those who thought they did not want to come and then regretted not coming, those who were there and are missing it already and those who are still there for the party.  And we are always thinking of all of you who will be there long past our departure getting it ready so we can come again, thank you.\n\nAs you can tell, I had a great time at [BM] I loved the weather, thanks for that big party in the desert!",
