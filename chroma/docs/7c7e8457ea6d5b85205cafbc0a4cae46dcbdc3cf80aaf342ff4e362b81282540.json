  "content": "Most of our discussions about the Renaissance have focused on the visual arts and the architecture – but the music of the Italian Renaissance was an explosion of polyphonic soundscapes.\n\nAnd it’s amazing.\n\nTo get a closer listen, we invited the San Francisco Renaissance Voices (a musical ensemble which I have long admired) to come into the Burning Man offices and perform sacred and secular music from the Italian Renaissance, with a particular emphasis on pieces that had a connection to Florence.\n\nAnd we recorded it, in case you’d like to listen too.\n\nSome of the individual songs are below.  The full playlist is here.\n\nHope you’re inspired on your way out to the dust!\n\n“Coppia Gentil” – by Cristoforo Malvezzi (1547 – 1599)\n\nLyrics:\n\nNoble couple of highly-favored lovers\nFor whom not only earth rejoices and makes merry\nBut, blazing with amorous zeal,\nHeaven too sings in joyous celebration.\n\n“Nasce la Gioia Mia” – by Giovan Leonardo Primavera, 1540 – 1585\n\nLyrics:\n\nMy joy is born\nevery time I look at my beautiful sun;\nbut my life is empty\nwhen I cannot see it,\nfor the very sight is bliss to me.\nO sun, immortal life-giving sun,\nnever hide yourself again,\nfor I know that if I cannot see you,\nlife could not be worse.\n\n“Morte che voi” – by Maddalena Casulana (1544 1590)\n\nLyrics:\n\nDeath, whom I call, behold, for I draw near.\nTake me and complete thereby all that remains of my sorrow.\nYou cannot do so?\nSince, in you, no longer shall my heart reign\nYes, no, have done!\nThe restore that which life can no longer destroy\n\n“Missa Nasce la gioia mia Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, Agnus Dei” – from a mass by Giovannia Pierluigi da Palestrina (1525 – 1594)\n\n“Il bianco e dolce cigno” – by Jacques Arcadelt (1504 – 1568)\n\nLyrics:\n\nThe white and sweet swan dies singing,\nAnd I, weeping, reach the end of my life.\nStrange and different fate, that he dies disconsolate\nAnd I die a blessed death,\nThat in dying fills me full of joy and desire.\nIf in dying were I to feel no other pain,\nI would be content to die a thousand deaths a day.\n\n“Stavasi il mio bel sol” – by Maddalena Casulana (1544 – 1590)\n\nHe* was my beautiful sun, and under the sun he sat.\nAnd no other beauty could ever be found,\nLoosening his blond mane of paradise,\nWhich reflected the face of my sun,\nAnd in that mirror he saw himself to be beautiful,\nAnd to my sun he appeared as the sun,\nAnd the sun saw himself to be beautiful too.\n*Gender is ambiguous; translator chose to use male pronouns.\n\nThe singers are:\nLisa May, soprano\nNaomi Braun, mezzo-soprano\nKatherine McKee, alto\nWill Betts & John Mansfield, tenors\nJohn-Elliott Kirk, bass\n\nPhoto by Chuck Revell",
