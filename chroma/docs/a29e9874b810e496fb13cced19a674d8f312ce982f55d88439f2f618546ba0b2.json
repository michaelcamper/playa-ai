  "content": "[Editor’s Note: for current information about drone operation in Black Rock City, visit our Drones and Lasers page.]\n\nYou may have noticed a proliferation of drones (those zippy little helicopter gizmos) humming around the skies of Black Rock City in recent years … or you’ve enjoyed the amazing photos and video footage they’ve shot over our fair city. Well, now that there’s so many of them, let’s make sure we’re all droning safely and in a coordinated way to avoid any mishaps, shall we? Right.\n\nSo … are you a drone or UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operator? Or are you thinking about becoming one? Are you planning to bring one (or several) to Black Rock City? Will you be using a camera mounted on a UAV to take images in BRC? Are you looking to connect with drone operators for a playa project? Are you just interested in learning more about those flying things?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you are invited to join us for the first ever Black Rock City Drone Summit. This will be an opportunity to share information about your projects and to help make Black Rock City an innovative, educational and fun Drone Zone.\n\nWHEN: July 17th, 2013 @ 6:30PM\nWHERE: BMHQ and via web-conference\nRSVP: http://goo.gl/k5Z4x\n\nCan’t make it? Please send a summary of your project and ideas to dronesummit@burningman.com and we’ll get you connected to summit notes and future discussions.",
