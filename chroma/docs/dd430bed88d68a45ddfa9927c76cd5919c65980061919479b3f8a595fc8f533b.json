  "content": "Burners around the world kept the flame burning brightly this past year. Some of us built an ephemeral city in the Black Rock Desert. That’s f-ing incredible! You also brought Regional Events back, made Burning Man art out in the world, and sparked connections, new and old. Every one of you brought your Burner spirit to collective projects; you shared the struggle, and the glory.\n\nWhat we do as Burners and as a global culture is important to the world. Burning Man in all its iterations gives us permission to bring our full selves to life. Through this process we create, we learn, we play, and we build a path forward for humanity.\n\nWe’d like to share gratitude from some of the humans who help make Black Rock City and global Burning Man culture happen. Feeling the love and gratitude too? Drop it in the comments.\n\nA City of Art — Imagined and Built by You\n\nKatie Hazard from the Art Department writes:\n\n“Art came back in a big way in 2022 — literally. Black Rock City had more art than ever! In the Art Department, our staff were thrilled to help make the magic happen by supporting so many artists after nearly three years of dreaming, planning, pausing, building, adapting, and evolving. Burning Man artists are so passionate about sharing their work in Black Rock City and that dedication was more evident than ever in 2022.\n\n“This year was a struggle for so many of us — particularly art crews — but as we looked out upon the open playa it was truly heartwarming to see their visions finally realized. We’re so proud of and grateful for the tremendous emotional and cultural impact that Burning Man art and artists have on our community and the world. It’s inspiring to see what we’re capable of when we work together!”\n\nThe Spirit of Gifting\n\nDanny Kaufman from the Philanthropic Engagement Department writes:\n\n“The spirit of gifting, and YOUR generosity these past two-and-a-half years allowed us to not only return to our dusty Home, but also to continue carrying out the year-round nonprofit programs that bring Burning Man culture out into the world. In all, more than 25,000 Burners around the globe stepped up and made a donation to Burning Man Project during this period, with more than 7,000 contributing in 2022.\n\n“We could not be more grateful or inspired by the kindheartedness of this community. We literally could not do this without you. If you would like to continue supporting this important work, please consider making a gift to Burning Man Project before the end of the year.”\n\nWe’re Endlessly Inspired by Global Burning Man Culture\n\nIris Yee from the Regional Network writes:\n\n“2022 was a comeback year in the Regional Network, the interconnected web of volunteer Regional Contacts and instigators who bring Burning Man culture into their local communities year round. Seventy percent of official Regional Events held in 2019 returned — 73 in-person gatherings in 18 countries and 27 US states!\n\n“Around the Burnerverse, there was a release of pent-up creative energy which manifested as a strong year for art at events. Simultaneously, Regional Contacts, official Regional Event organizers, and community leaders came together virtually in workshops and forums to teach, learn, and explore how Burning Man gatherings, spaces, and projects can be more inclusive, environmentally sustainable, and meaningfully connected.\n\n“Thank each of you for tending the fire in your own way, keeping the culture alive while experimenting in new and inspiring ways. We can’t do this without all of you!”",
