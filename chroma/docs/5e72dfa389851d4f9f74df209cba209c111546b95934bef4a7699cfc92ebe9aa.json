  "content": "We know that for many, securing a ticket is what solidifies Black Rock City plans and kicks off other projects related to the Burn. Opening that envelope in the mail, seeing the Survival Guide, and enjoying a Fireball candy makes it all real.\n\nWe are pleased to announce an Invitation to the Future!\n\nThe idea is simple: Those who have the financial means can buy a reservation that guarantees access to purchase one ticket to each of the next two Black Rock City events at the published Main Sale price. In other words, securing a reservation ensures you have an opportunity to get a ticket the next two times we can gather together in Black Rock City. This is a chance to secure your own future participation in Black Rock City and support Burning Man Project.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nVisit your Burner Profile to get started right away!\n\nFull details can be found on the Burning Man ticketing page.\n\nWhile many have been hit hard financially this past year, others are able to help without sacrificing their own comfort and wellbeing. The Invitation to the Future is a way for those who can to demonstrate their belief in the global cultural importance of Burning Man and Black Rock City – a way to invest in the limitless possibilities of our co-created future.\n\nThe Burning Man community has always depended on each individual contributing when and how they are able, trusting in the natural balance of the organism to shift, rise, and compensate as needed. It is on the strength of our beautifully varied backgrounds and lived experiences that the community must now rely more than ever. The Invitation to the Future is an expression of the extraordinary Communal Effort that will be required to continue offering the healing and inspiration of Burning Man to the world.\n\nWhere does this money go?\n\nRunning a global, year-round arts nonprofit is a huge undertaking. Securing a reservation to the future allows us to continue the work of returning to Black Rock City safely. It’s our number one priority, and what our entire staff (and we know, many of you, too!) wake up every day thinking about. We are also charged with supporting the global, year-round Burning Man culture, a responsibility we care about very deeply. Reservations to the future will enable Burning Man Project to both bring back Black Rock City and continue doing the important work of supporting and empowering our global community through our nonprofit programs.\n\nRemember, Burning Man Project doesn’t have corporate sponsors (see Decommodification), and ticket sales are normally 90% of our annual revenue. Over the course of 2020, we received gifts of $10 to $5,000,000 from more than 21,000 generous, amazing people to help us through the collective dust storm of the past year. We’ve heard loud and clear that people would like to show their support for the future of Burning Man by securing access to future tickets. Offering reservations to the future will give an opportunity to those wishing to support our future, while also serving as an invitation for some to begin planning their next BRC adventure.\n\nWhat about the 2021 Directed Group Sale and Main Sale?\n\nThose of you who are part of the various Directed Group Sale (DGS) teams have already received notifications from the respective departments (Placement, DMV, Art) to submit your needs for 2021. Because of the many steps involved, we have to continue preparations so we are ready to go if we can build BRC this year, but we do not expect to be activating the DGS or other sales until closer to a “go” decision is made.\n\nSee you in the future!\n\nCover photo by Juan Zapata",
