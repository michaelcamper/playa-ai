  "content": "So for the last couple months, some current and past Burning Man Meta-Regionals have been getting together every other week or so to chat with a special guest who is … what’s the phrase they use … “kind of famous at Burning Man.”  Mostly they’re not really talking “about Burning Man,” so much as they’re just telling stories about anything and everything. You know, they way you do when it’s late and everybody’s sitting around a burn barrel, drinking.\n\nThey’ve been mostly keeping it quiet for a bit, while they figured out what they were doing and how they wanted it to go.  But now they’re opening it up to the public. It’s a nice format: it’s a webinar, so you can only see and hear the panelists, but you can send comments to them via chat, and if you have a question you can be brought on the video as a panelist to ask it directly.\n\nWanna stop on by? It’s on every other Thursday. We’ve had a bunch of artists, we’ve had Dave X, Will Chase will be there this Thursday … and they interviewed me a maybe a month or so ago. It’s not an official Burning Man production — and that’s on purpose — so you never know what’s going to be said.\n\nTo keep posted on the who’s and the whens, check in here. You can also watch some — but only some — of the recent conversations there.\n\nHere’s two clips from the time when they had me on as a guest (I’m usually also there as a panelist). In the first clip, I’m asked what it is that I think works in the creation of “Burning Man” experiences in a digital format.\n\nIn the second, I talk about my increasingly strong contention that focusing on”platforms” kind of misses the point. The question is: what kind of human experience are you offering? And how do you do that? Much in the way that the best theme camps are often not the most expensive and constructed, but made out of cardboard and duct cape and an idea, so the best digital experiences are less focused on the technology and instead hav an idea of how to reach through the screen and connect in the meaningful ways that we still can.\n\n(My more lengthy and developed thoughts on these issues are found here)\n\nHope you enjoy, and that I’ll see you around the burn barrel sometime!\n\nPhoto by Wendell DeLano",
