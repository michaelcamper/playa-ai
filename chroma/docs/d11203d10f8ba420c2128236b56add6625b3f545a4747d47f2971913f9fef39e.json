  "content": "Hey there sports fans, MOOP maniacs and line sweepers extraordinaire! The Hun here, reporting from Gerlach where the DPW Playa Restoration team is in fine form.\n\nIn their second day of Line Sweeps, the team marched through the remaining blocks between Liminal, Kindergarten and Journey. Then, with barely a break for water, they continued through most of Initiation and Hajj, setting an all-time record of 62 blocks!\n\nThose of you who know how the MOOP Map is made will immediately recognize that a record-setting day translates to a lot of green, MOOP-free areas. So without further ado, here’s your MOOP Map as of Day Two:\n\nToday’s score: 80% green, 19% yellow and 1% red. Great job, Black Rock City. You’re keeping your commitment to the Leave No Trace ethic, and you’re making it possible for the Restoration team to win, win, win!\n\nDA, Playa Restoration team manager, had this to say:\n\nLine Sweep Team 2, led by NikO Peaches, seemed to run into some trouble with a consistent streak of whole blocks of stop-and-go Yellow. When one team is on a Green block and the other is on a Yellow block, it becomes quickly apparent which side is the messier: One Team will be waiting at the finish line while the others are still bending over for MOOP in the center of the block.\n\nTomorrow we’ll finish our warm-up time on the back blocks H-I-J, and then we’ll jump up to 10:00 and Esplanade!\n\nCoyote Nose: It Ain’t Easy Bein’ Green\n\nThe MOOP Map had humble beginnings, but it’s no small deal these days. Just read this tale from Black Rock City Superintendent Tony “Coyote” Perez:\n\nIt was Tuesday after the Man had fallen and I was doing my annual roll around to advise and assist in the painful process that all share of removing the fat and colorful root that their grand camps had sunk into the playa over the week. Most are getting pretty stellar in their efforts having developed slick systems over the years, but some are new and learning — most times the hard way.\n\nI rolled up on a hectic group that was wildly flapping their hands and arms at me. They were beckoning me over, seeing the DPW logos on my truck, and they were literally livid with emotion and strife. Many of them were in tears and some of the guys were shouldering murderous eyes with murderous intentions. They were members of a fairly large theme camp (some can be in the hundreds), and it seems that in the pre dawn night, some “complete idiot!” had driven what looked like a pretty large truck right through what remained of their camp and right over their very large and brimming grey water tank, annihilating it and creating a massive putrid mud mess! Nobody could stop the hit and run.\n\nWhat were the first words out of their mouths when they stormed my truck window?\n\n“Please help us! We don’t know how to deal with this kind of a mess! We didn’t do this – some asshole fucked us in the night! Please don’t red flag us on the MOOP map! We don’t want to get red flagged on the MOOP map!!!”\n\nI calmed them down telling them that we would certainly work with them to solve our mutual problem, and that all would be well and together we would realize that ultimate nirvana and zen rush of achieving green on the MOOP map. And all the while, I was harboring an inner smile thinking, “Damn, that map is sure starting to grow some teeth!”\n\nAin’t nothing more powerful than a community that has developed that thing called a mind set. The Playa Restoration crew isn’t making the MOOP map greener every year, the participants are. The Resto crew is just making the strides to carefully document it the best they can. Sure, it will never be infallible, but it will always be a pretty good indicator as to whom we might at least start a conversation with.\n\n— That’s all for today, folks. Tune in tomorrow, when we finish up the outer blocks and jump straight up to Esplanade! ‘Til then, this is The Hun signing off.",
