  "content": "I got a message in my inbox about fundraising for the 2015 Temple.\n\nAnd it made me think about how the Burning Man Temples have impacted my life.\n\nI’ve hugged, sobbed, spoken and performed weddings there.\n\nI’ve taken offerings to the Temple for myself, family members and online friends.\n\nI have sobbed so deeply that I can barely recognize what it was I was feeling… just that I was FEELING.\n\nI have read the written words and felt soul-connected to people I have never met. I’ve had conversations there about the nature of life itself.\n\nThe Temples have changed what my concept of “art” could be and what a sacred space was.\n\nWhat is the value of a place where all this is possible?\n\nPriceless, of course.\n\nThank you to everyone who has helped design, build, fund, and protect the Temples of the past. I appreciate the opportunity to contribute towards this year’s Temple. (Fundraiser ends in a few days)",
