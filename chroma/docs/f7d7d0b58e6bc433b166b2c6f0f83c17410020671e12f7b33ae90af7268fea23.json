  "content": "We start with a piece of sand\nA boy alone in an empty theater\nFloating through the air\nLike the head of Ichabod.\nThen We bring hundreds more\nWarriors at the gates of dust\nBricklayers staring at a clay wall\nDirections written on cracked earthgrids.\nWe decide to invite thousands\nAn urban sprawl of alkaline\nA square block in a New York desert\nA stadium of pulsing dirt hooligans.\nAnd suddenly we’re in the millions\nA crowded briefcase of greenbacks\nA clamoring of dots on Earth’s monitor\nA warring tribe invading the peaceful air\nOur Dust.\nOur Playa.\nComing soon.\nWhiting out a desert near You.\n\nby Supa Star Smurf",
