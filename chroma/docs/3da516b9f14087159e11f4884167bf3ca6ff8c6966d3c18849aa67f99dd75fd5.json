  "content": "On April 19, 2014, the Burning Man Project and ArtIsMobilUs collaborated to create the first ever AnyKidCanPaint “Our Earth”, and first three sided ARTwall at Earth Day SF. In addition ArtIsMobilUs provided an Earth Wall for everyone to paint or write what they love about about the earth.\n\nThe process for this collaboration started a couple of weeks earlier at a Burning Man Project Volunteer Appreciation Party. During the party the scissors came out and along with celebratory toasts to the volunteers there was much clipping to be done to make animal prints for the kids.\n\nAlix, one of our volunteers was fortunate to have lived in India, deep in the jungles of Malaysia and Thailand, and has spent a lot of time under the sea with its colorful inhabitants, said:",
