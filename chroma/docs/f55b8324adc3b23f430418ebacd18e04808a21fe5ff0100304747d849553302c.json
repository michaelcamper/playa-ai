Canopy — Star Year 2024\n\nFor the last four months I’ve been deeply immersed in world-building and designing outrageous experiences in the heart of this year’s version of Black Rock City. As the Center Camp Plaza Project Manager, I have the privilege, honor, and great responsibility to hold space for, and in some cases actively orchestrate, the center of the swirl. My mission is to catalyze the emergence of something new, fantastic, and outrageously engaging in a zone that knew its identity for decades, and then plummeted into an odd type of existential decay over the last two years.\n\nFrom a Ghost Town…\n\n“Ghost Town” is the term I’ve heard used most often to describe what Center Camp became after the COVID-19 pause, and it’s a phrase that fits the desert imaginal scape quite well. I’ve combatted this dismal spell in my own mental space with a conjuring of my own. I dream of myself as a boisterous buckaroo, sauntering into the whistling wild west center of town with bubble guns and kazoos strapped to my bandolier, jokers up my sleeves, and a magic squeaky rubber chicken whose squawk calls in the merrymakers, the pranksters, the zany gag-wits and cutup clowns from across the lands. “Ghost Town no longer,” at least if my magic rubber chicken’s got anything to say about it!\n\nAnd yet, it’s important to recognize that the decline we experienced is part of a larger cycle. Seeing the Center Camp fields lay fallow for a few years gave us the opportunity to experience what it’s like when the heart of the city is empty. From the barren landscape of service camps dark at night, to the image of an unattended canopy cordoned off because it had become a lake in 2023, these memories give us the permission to dream anew and ask the important question:\n\nWhat wants to spring to life in the center of our great city, here at this important cultural nexus point?\n\nUrban Renewal and Cultural Revitalization in the Heart of the City\n\nIt inspires me to report that the concepts of urban renewal and cultural revitalization have been important driving forces in the reimagining of our Center Camp experience. The minds at Burning Man Project and engaged Burners in the community are regularly ruminating on these academic wrinkles. What we are collectively building this year is born from the fruits of their musing.\n\nA fascinating alignment is emerging. This alignment of thinkers and doers, of minds and hearts and desires, is calling forth innovation and a return to togetherness and joyful engagement. It’s like a giant magnet, pulling weird art, wondrous characters, and satirical shticks into an epicenter of awe that will manifest in physical reality smack dab in the midst of the Central Plaza and Center Camp Canopy. Rejuvenation is upon us, mark my words. What’s more, it won’t look like it’s looked in the past  — so prepare for that new-new.\n\nOne of the most unique facets of our beloved Black Rock City, which sets it apart from every other city on the planet, is the amazingly short urban lifecycle. Across all the cities we know in the world — which we’ve grown up in or visited on vacation or spent four years grinding in their local university halls and service industries — the city lifecycle generally traverses six phases: rapid growth, slow growth, shrinkage, decay, renewal, and revitalization. For the most part, these phases play out over long time horizons, decades or even generations.This is due to the fact that most city streets are paved; the urban planning is complex, rigid, and institutionalized, and the buildings are made of wood and bricks and stone and steel.\n\nYet in Black Rock City, where the infrastructure is held together by rebar, zip ties, and dreams, and the canvas is wiped clean down to playa each year to build anew, we’re provided with a much more responsive and condensed urban lifecycle. In this special petri dish, the implications for learning about the cultural mechanics underlying urban transformation are tremendous — and not just in theory, but in lived practice.\n\nWhat will be gleaned from the experiment at hand?\n\nWill we step up to innovate and create together? Will we harvest the learnings from our unique experiment and provide valuable contributions to society at large?\n\nOnly time and the omniscient magic rubber chicken can tell.\n\nBut What Will It Look Like? To the Galactic Center We Go!\n\nHere’s what I will share, just to be fair to those of you who’ve made it this far: The new Center Camp Neighborhood will be nothing short of a new Galactic Center, alive with weird Burning Man everything. The Plaza is full of theme camps with a balanced array of daytime and nighttime activities. Service camps have been moved out to the Esplanade or peripheral neighborhoods. Rod’s Ring Road is gone; it was time for a change to the neighborhood layout, bringing the energy into the center.\n\nIn the Plaza you’ll find a ski slope, a piano bar, a jazz lounge, a few fabulous watering holes, a home-brew beer hall, a sunrise cafe that serves breakfast sandwiches and caffeinated goodness, a teahouse, two karaoke spots, a carousel, roaming appliance robots, and a couple of fire stages where the city’s best fire spinners will be imbuing the space with bold fury! A total of eight camps around the Plaza will be serving muddy bean juice, so hopefully we can just leave that at that. The Plaza was curated by our Placement team intentionally to uplift and encourage the objectives of rejuvenating the zone into a bustling downtown district.\n\nThen there’s the Canopy. This is a place where I’ll opt to leave much of the plans to be a surprise. And what an epic surprise it will be. What I don’t mind disclosing now is that there will be hundreds of activated collaborators bringing their special sauce into the center of the center. A center stage will be built the likes of which center camp has never seen. French Quarter will be installing an epic hundred-foot-long dining room table that will feature absurd tea parties, crafternoon sessions, gaming tournaments, and ridiculous dining pop-ups. You can expect an Around the Clock Teahouse with ceremonial tea service 24/7. There are 16 alcoves around the perimeter of the Canopy featuring cool micro-environments and devious spontaneous experiences. There will be many of the staples you’ve known and loved over the years, such as contact improv, a new and improved art gallery, a speaker series, the People’s Fashion Show, the Cacophony Society mixer, the Billion Bunny Takeover, and spoken word poetry of questionable quality. And there will be new things that Center Camp has only dreamed of hosting before … like the Burner Olympics, the Genius Hour variety show, Black Rock Blackjack, a grand trading post, and so much more… I can’t believe I’m leaving it at “and so much more…” But for real, there is SO MUCH MORE. You might just burst your fun meters, so maybe leave those at home. For those of you keen to brush up on all the happenings, you can peruse the Playa Events Guide for Center Camp activities. Also when you arrive on playa, you’ll want to take a gander at the WhatWhereWhen guide’s sexy Center Camp centerfold — featuring events beneath the Canopy!\n\nIf you feel the energetic pull to embark on this journey of renewal and revitalization and you wish to add your intentions to the cauldron, you are cordially invited to participate in the Opening Ceremony, Sunday August 25th at 7:30pm at the main entrance to the Canopy. Let’s convene and remember that the heart of Burning Man isn’t just in the art or the music or the beverages that help us wake up. The heart of BRC is found in the connections forged and the spaces shared. It’s about the magic of the moments spent with other adventurers, in time as it passes. How very precious these fleeting experiences are.\n\nSquawk Squawk!\n\nCaptain Gabriel, signing off for now. May we meet in the new Center Camp Canopy Galactic Center soon. And until then may your journeys be filled with dust, dreams, and delightful surprises.",
