  "content": "Burners are tinkerers. More than that, many of us are makers and technologists who venture out into the Black Rock Desert to learn, innovate and prototype. It comes as no surprise that there is a ton of solar expertise in the Burning Man community – so much that Burners are ahead of the curve, exploring and prototyping technology that is leading the world.\n\nGoing Solar, the latest documentary by the all-volunteer Profiles in Dust crew, profiles several teams whose Black Rock City 2022 solar projects are working towards a net zero Black Rock City. Their work, and the learning and collaboration within the broader Burning Man community, is bringing us closer to meeting our Environmental Sustainability Roadmap goal to be carbon negative by 2030.\n\nAnd they’ve only just begun. Whether led by Burning Man Project or the community, these sustainability projects continue to evolve into 2023. Jump below the video for a list of collaborative groups you can get involved with — no matter your current level of knowledge on solar energy.\n\nDuring the pause between 2019 and 2022 Burners got busy and our collective knowledge about solar energy grew incrementally. Several teams working closely together rolled out solar systems and community education that came to fruition in Black Rock City 2022.\n\nAll these teams are going full steam ahead for Black Rock City 2023, scaling and advancing solar projects and education. All are welcome to participate — here’s how you can get involved:\n\n2023 Sustainability Year Four Update\n\nOn July 21, 2023 you’re invited to join our 2023 Sustainability Report: Year Four Update to connect with the projects and people leading Burning Man’s sustainability efforts. Register here.\n\nGreen Theme Camp Community (GTCC)\n\nGTCC is a community-led group stewarding Burners towards the goals laid out in the 2030 Sustainability Roadmap. Two projects under their umbrella are Burner Leadership Achieving Sustainable Theme Camps (BLAST) rating system and the Thrival Guide, a future open source playbook of sustainable playa infrastructure. Join their Facebook group to learn about the next GTCC online happy hour and find out more on their website.\n\nJoin GTCC April 25, 2023 on Campfire Talks for “Sustainability is a BLAST!” Members of GTCC will talk about their work on Thrival Guide and BLAST, you’ll meet some BLAST-rated camps from 2022, and discuss what it means to be a camp sustainability lead. Register here.\n\nBurner Leadership Achieving Sustainable Theme Camp (BLAST)\n\nBLAST is a green theme camp certification system developed along the lines of LEED certification for green buildings. In 2022 they met with, assessed and rated 20 camps across six focus areas — food, power, water waste, shelter and transport. View the results on their HIVE page. BLAST will be back for Black Rock City 2023 and they’re looking for camps to review; fill out this form if your camp is interested, and join BLAST on Hive to get involved.\n\nRenewables for Artists Team (RAT)\n\nRAT is a community-run group that offers education and technical support to help artists switch from fuel generators to renewable energy. They’ve rolled out a series of solar power courses in Burning Man Hive, including Solar Power 101 and Solar Powered Art on the Playa. In 2022 RAT supported 12 artists on playa, including powering the portals on the path from the Man to the Temple. They’ll once again be supporting artists in Black Rock City 2023. All are invited to participate in RAT’s weekly meetings in Hive. Learn more on their website.\n\nBurning Man Project’s Solar Crew\n\nThe solar program started in 2021 out of necessity as a part of the 2030 sustainability initiatives. Burning Man Project has invested in acquiring solar resources with the aim to help alleviate our dependency for diesel generators and associated logistics on playa.\n\nThe Solar Crew continues to innovate with the design and creation of three new portable solar prototypes. Building on last year’s success, we’ll be expanding our fleet with a solar-powered refrigerated container, and new solar-powered workshop/living containers for use in Black Rock City 2023 and on our Northern Nevada properties year-round. In 2022 the team successfully rolled out 42 Baby Wookiees, which are 2.4 kW PV solar trailers used to power art projects and support city infrastructure. Burning Man Project also deployed two larger systems we call the Unicorns. These 30kW PV arrays mounted on containers were deployed as test cases, one to power a solar camp and the other to illuminate the Man throughout Burn Week.\n\nBlack Rock Labs\n\nBlack Rock Labs is a nonprofit technology incubator working with the Burning Man community to develop and scale solar energy systems that can be used in Black Rock City, and then implemented year round in the wider world. The knowledge and technology that emerge through this process can then be deployed in disaster sites and other urgent situations.\n\nWe’ll close with a quote from Going Solar.
