  "content": "Reverse Parade (Vermont)\n\nBurners in Vermont organized a Reverse Parade, encouraging folks to set off legal fireworks in their front yards along a parade route. Everyone was invited to drive by or watch and cheer from a safe distance.\n\nMission Veleta (Argentina)\n\nBurners in Argentina created Mission Veleta, inviting those sheltering in place to post a wish that others could “adopt” to make that wish come true. Adoptable wishes included everything from singing a comforting song, to delivering a favorite food. Burners also made phone calls to elderly people living alone, breaking the isolation with support and friendly conversation.\n\nTahoe’s MOOP the Lake (California)\n\nMore than 50 Tahoe Burners, in collaboration with their local Burners Without Borders group, participated in MOOP the Lake, a cleanup effort to remove litter in the Lake Tahoe caused by a COVID-related spike in tourism. Small socially-distanced teams, dressed to delight and express themselves, collected more than 235 pounds of MOOP across 21 locations between September 8-10.\n\nSacramento’s ‘MOOP Your City’ Trash Collection Challenge (California)\n\nOn August 29, Sacramento Burners and friends kicked off a MOOP Your City Trash Collection Challenge to make their community streets, parks and beaches cleaner. The challenge drew 15 teams (from Sacramento, Ventura, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Berlin) with 70 participants who collected 450 pounds of MOOP.\n\nSacramento Valley’s Summer Spark Drive Thru 2020 (California)\n\nThis summer, regional Burners attracted 900 cars to their COVID-safe drive-thru experience, which featured installation art, mutant vehicles and fiery dance performances.\n\nArt on Fire (Idaho)\n\nIdaho Burner Alliance raised funds for artists and the Idaho Suicide Prevention Hotline with an Art on Fire online art auction… with a twist: art that did not sell was burned in a LIVE streaming event.\n\nSouth Bay Art Collective — Pocket Exhibit (California)\n\nUndeterred by the lockdown, the Bay Area’s Triton Museum of Art created “pocket exhibitions” to share mini videos with friends, art lovers, and anyone who needs art in their life during quarantine.\n\nSeattle’s “Halloweekend Art Jaunt” (Washington)\n\nOver Halloween weekend, Seattle Burners led participants on a COVID-safe trek around city neighborhoods to admire lawn art created by the community. This art excursion built upon an August “Seattle Multiverse Actual Reality Trek” (SMART), which used an augmented digital map to bring people to locally-created and safely distanced performances, art and theme camp experiences.\n\nBurn Before Reading Online Magazine (Massachusetts)\n\nA new Boston-based arts and literature journal created by and for the Burner community provides a space where Burners can publish their work and see what others have created.\n\nBurning Survivors TRY Day (Multi-Region)\n\nOrganized by Regional Contact alumna Cinemagirl (New York),  Burning Survivors invited cancer survivors and their loved ones to participate in a global “TRY Day” on August 16. Participants were encouraged to push their limits while raising money for cancer-related non-profit organizations. (A TRY is any physical feat you choose, train for, and push yourself to do.)\n\nCHIditarod BBQ Cart + Arts in the Dark Upside Down Parade (Illinois)\n\nCHIditarod provided hundreds of pounds of BBQ and offered drive-by meals for folks in the Chicago area. Chicago Burners also held an ‘Arts in the Dark Upside Down Parade’ that invited anyone to drive by and experience performances by fire spinners, DJs, and more — all safe and socially distanced.\n\nAmber Burn (Lithuania)\n\nThe Lithuanian Regional Burn, originally scheduled for July 2020, was postponed until August. All participants were required to wear masks and have their temperatures checked before being admitted to the event. No COVID cases were reported among the 777 Burners in attendance from more than 20 countries. Regional Burners in Lithuania also organized and held an Art Bike Invasion Workshop at the Zero Waste Festival on August 7-9.\n\nAmber Burn was one of 11 in-person official Burning Man Regional Events in 2020. Seven were held before COVID-19 changed our world; four were held post COVID-19, following safety precautions in parts of the world where it was still possible to responsibly organize in-person gatherings.\n\nAfrikaBurn’s eCOMPRESSION (South Africa)\n\nTravis Lyle, Head of Communications for AfrikaBurn, shared an update on South Africa’s official online Regional Event, eCompression. “It was a great online session all in all and we saw a spread of very diverse contributions from the community, including some fantastic live African instrumental performances.” The event included 25 streamed performances, discussions, workshops, storytelling sessions, and artworks. Up to 1,100 unique visitors participated over the entire weekend of July 3-5, 2020. Fifty-five live-streamed and pre-recorded DJ performances came in from as far and wide as Germany and France, as well as from various corners of South Africa.\n\neCompression was one of 10 official Burning Man events that went online in 2020.\n\nKlosterneuburn & Schönburn (Austria)\n\nThanks in part to the invention of the “Butt Hug” (seen in the instructional video below), 50 Burners were safely able to gather at Klosterneuburn in August, and 100 Burners attended Schönburn in September.\n\nBurn Night: Live From Home (Multi-Region)\n\nShout out to everyone who submitted one-minute videos of their effigy burns, celebrations, and Regional Events as a part of our ’round-the-clock global Burn Night! Burn Night: Live From Home was a resounding success; more than 51,000 digital devices connected to the LIVE stream from around the world.",
