  "content": "You are now entering National Week of Making! The United States now has a whole week-long celebration of people who take it upon themselves to make the world they want to live in (hint: that’s us). If it wasn’t already on your calendar, hopefully it will be from now on. It’s pretty well timed to rally us all to finish our playa projects, you must admit.\n\nMaking your own stuff for practical or pleasurable reasons might seem second-nature to you, but it doesn’t take much looking around to see that, by and large, our economy and culture expects us to consume stuff instead. Makers everywhere are standing up to that, though, and this week, we can shout it from the rooftops. All week, we’ll be highlighting interesting maker projects from Burner and Burner-adjacent worlds here in the Journal to give you a taste of how big and interesting the maker movement has become.\n\nHow did this week come about? Who’s responsible for making making into a thing at the national level? We talked to Dorothy Jones-Davis, Executive Director of Nation of Makers, to get the skinny.\n\nWhat is National Week of Making all about?\n\nWhat a cool thing to be in charge of. How did you get into being a maker at all, let alone running Nation of Makers?\n\nIt’s cool that it happened in childhood for you. In the Burner and maker communities, there’s a bunch of adults spending tons of time and money making things, even though adulthood nowadays doesn’t seem to support this kind of thing. How did making become a career for you?\n\nHow do you define what a Maker with a capital M is?\n\nThere aren’t that many spaces out there devoted to this creativity. How do you see maker spaces evolving, and what’s your hope for the future of devoted spaces to creativity?\n\nTell us more about what you mean by “find your tribe.” That sounds rather Burning Man-ish.\n\nAbout Dorothy Jones-Davis:\n\nDorothy joined Nation of Makers as its Executive Director in March 2017. An eternal optimist and connector, Dorothy is deeply interested in finding ways to create connections between a diversity of makers, leveraging their collective skills to harness solutions for the world’s challenges, grand and small.\n\nShe envisions Nation of Makers as a collaborative community, one where organizations of different types can learn from one another and share best practices, and where shared engagement fosters the development of long lasting partnerships that have outcomes that reach farther than any one entity could accomplish alone.\n\nFor more of her story, check out her blog post, “Why I Make”.\n\nImages courtesy of Nation of Makers",
