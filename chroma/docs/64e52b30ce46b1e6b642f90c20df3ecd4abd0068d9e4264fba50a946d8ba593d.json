  "content": "Congratulations, Citizens of Black Rock!\n\nThe final BLM Site Inspection Report is still being finalized, but in the meantime we’re excited to be able to share the high-resolution version of the 2017 MOOP Map. You really all pulled together to fight the rise in MOOP, and it shows: This is one of the cleanest and greenest MOOP Maps yet!\n\nLeaving No Trace isn’t just one of the Ten Principles of Burning Man, it is essential part of the responsibility and stewardship we all take for the Black Rock Desert, critical to our continued ability to return there. And as much as we like to share the stories of our incredible Playa Restoration volunteers, without the daily commitment that you make to leaving no trace at Burning Man, results like what you see below would never be possible.\n\nThanks to everyone who didn’t let MOOP hit the ground, and thanks to everyone who picked it up if it did. Thanks to everyone who walked a line sweep, MOOPed their camps, or helped with general city clean up. You are the true heroes of the playa, and the desert winds will forever whisper your names. But your mission doesn’t end here! This year, teach at least one other person what Leave No Trace means and why it is so important. You possess a weird and priceless skill! Share it with others, so that future MOOP maps will forever be as green as the one we are proud to share with you today.\n\nRemember! The only thing necessary for the triumph of MOOP is that good burners do nothing.\n\nSee you all in 136 days.\n-Slim",
