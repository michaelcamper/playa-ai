This was an action-packed, blink-of-the-eye visit to NY.\n\nHave you heard of Governors Island? It’s a little isle on the Hudson that used to belong to the military and government. It boasts two different forts from the war of 1812 as well as military quarters for the officers stationed there. After 9/11, President Bush sold the island to NY for $1. It now hosts a slew of cultural and temporary events and things are currently ramping up there for Summer 2008.\n\nTwo of the five NYC Regional Contacts, NTD and Oscar helped arrange a visit to the island in order to check out Emergence House which received a grant from the Black Rock Arts Foundation. The grand opening of the gallery was 5/28/08. What an amazing experience it was to visit such an old Victorian House that is chock full of temporary interactive art. Over 30 individual installations and over 40 artists have come together to create a temporary interactive art house for 9 weeks.\n\nGovernors Island will play hosts to not one, but TWO granted projects from the Black Rock Arts Foundation. Later this summer “City of Dreams Mini Golf” will be installed as part of the Figment celebration taking place June 27 – 29, 2008.\n\nNo visit to NYC can happen without a quick stop by the weekly Burner Happy Hour. This was a particularly exciting one being the first Happy Hour to happen after two Regional Burns that draw New Yorkers out into the world. It was a great chance to connect with new friends made at Playa del Fuego and meet some folks who had just returned from Burning Flipside in Austin, TX.\n\nSpecial surprise visit from Donna the Palm Beach, FL Regional Contact who happened to be in town and came out to say hello. At one point there were five Regionals Contacts in the house but alas, I wasn’t able to round everyone up for a group photo before tight schedules pulled everyone out into the night.\n\nI think it goes without saying that there is never a dull visit to NY. This trip upheld that theory once again. Visitors and residents in NYC can get in touch with the Regional Contact team there directly via: newyork(at)burningman(dot)com. Or check out the NYC page on the Regionals section of burningman.com.",
