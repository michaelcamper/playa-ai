  "content": "The Cultural Vision for Residential Black Rock City is here!\n\nKnow before you read:\n\nThe Cultural Direction Setting project launched in October 2018. For the past 10 months, we’ve read over 10,000 people’s thoughts, listened, discussed, and drafted the vision to guide the culture of residential Black Rock City for the next five to 10 years. We hope we’ll begin to feel the effects of the vision in 2019 and to experience it more fully in 2020 and beyond.\n\nThe Cultural Vision is available in two formats – online and as a PDF. We’ve also created a shorter snapshot of the Cultural Vision if you’re short on time.  We invite you to read the vision, annotate it, think about it, and talk about it.\n\nNow that this guiding document is out in the world, here’s what happens next.\n\nShare it: We invite you to bring this vision to your camp, team, collective, fellow Black Rock City citizens, and interested future participants who you know to discuss how you can contribute to bringing this vision to life. At your next meeting, talk about how you as individuals and as a group can take whatever parts inspire and excite you and make them actionable.\n\nIf there’s something your group already does that supports the vision, share it in the comments on this post, in the ePlaya conversation, or on this social network’s related group. Share what you’re planning to take into your own hands. What you share will inspire and help us all in the next phase of making the vision real.\n\nJoin us in the discussion: On the playa, we’ll activate and discuss the vision. In early August we’ll announce all of the talks, Q&As, and opportunities to engage in the desert. We invite you to create opportunities to discuss this at gatherings where these cultural values are needed and being brought to life outside of Black Rock City.\n\nThe next phase: After Black Rock City comes and goes, specialized groups will work on how to implement and operationalize the vision. Each group will focus on a particular topic and turn the vision into the process. Where needed, criteria, policy, guidelines, and educational materials will be created or updated that help us throughout the year and on the ground in Black Rock City.\n\nThese groups will include relevant stakeholders for each topic, such as camp leaders, community members, Placement Team members, and Burning Man department representatives. Stay tuned for an announcement about how these groups will be formed and for opportunities to share your input.\n\nIt will take all of us as individuals and as camps to make it real. We hope you will join us in guiding the culture of this city we all love so dearly so that it evolves positively and continues well into the future.",
