Bruiser guided the crowd as they got into position. “All right, everyone pick up the rope.”\n\n“Okay, so everyone together take five steps backward.”\n\n“ONE. TWO. THREE. FOUR. FIVE.”\n\nThe Man slowly began to rise, and cheers rippled down the line.\n\nAfter three or four good lifts, the Man was nearly in place. With a few half steps, he was eased into place. “POINT FIVE!” the crowd exclaimed, taking a half step.\n\n“All right, we got it.”\n\nA roar of excitement swept through the crowd after having taking part in the radical ritual of raising the Man, an homage to Burning Man’s early history, roots and community.",
