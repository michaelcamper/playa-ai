  "content": "Every year since 2001, the Man has stood atop an elaborate base designed to reflect the spirit of that year’s art theme — and each one has included some kind of interactive element.  This year, the art theme is Fertility 2.0, contemplating the tendency of any being or living system to create abundant life.\n\nAs such, the Man will be perched atop a dramatic pavilion reminiscent of the Pantheon of ancient Rome, under which will stand an intricate 38′-tall sculpture representing a flower’s pistil. In case your memory of high school biology has eroded as much as ours, pistil (from the Latin pistillum meaning pestle) describes each discrete unit of the gynoecium, a collective term for the reproductive organs of a flower. (Phew … thanks Wikipedia!)\n\nThis sculpture will be designed and built by Gregg Fleishman, who created last year’s contemplative and peaceful “Otic Oasis” structure found out in the outer reaches of walk-in camping (and which will return to the same spot this year, we’re happy to report).\n\nAs with Otic Oasis, a series of stairways and walkways will provide access to a number of platforms, allowing participants the opportunity to climb, explore and enjoy the intricate architectural dynamics of the pistil.\n\nIn the spirit of participation, you’re encouraged to discover your inner bee, joining together with others or working solo to create interactive experiences of your own. Break out your best bee costume and inspired creativity and express yourself through bee culture and couture … perhaps coordinate a sunset bee swarm? Play follow the queen? Organize a honey tasting? Conduct a kazoo orchestra in a rendition of “Flight of the Bumblebee”? (It’s all good, but yeah, please don’t actually pollinate the pistil … capice?)\n\nWant to connect with other folks to collaborate in your creativity?  We’ve created a special discussion thread on the ePlaya to do just that, or you can of course use Facebook, shout it at some random guy at a bar, or use whatever method works for you … but have at it! Perhaps tapping into your local regional group will be the source of collaborative riches?\n\nFor your planning purposes, please note that the structure will be open from Sunday, August 26th at midnight through Friday, August 31st at 9pm(ish), when the Man starts to undergo its preparation for immolation. There will also be limited access during the CORE burn on Thursday night from around 8-10pm.\n\nEnjoy!",
