  "content": "Signs are going up all over the city now, signs to tell you where you’re camped, signs to tell you where to turn, and signs to welcome you home.\n\nThere’s a beautiful new sign at the turnoff for the Burning Man event site. In year’s past, there was always a gorgeous painted billboard welcoming visitors, but this year’s version is an advance.\n\nIt’s an intricately carved wooden piece with the “Rites of Passage” message, and Ghost Dancer and a crew of DPW folks were out at the entrance hanging it in the hot sun.\n\nMy guess is this one will come down before the event is over, because it would make an irresistible souvenir for someone on their way out.\n\nEnjoy the view on the way in.",
