They’re not going to babysit them for you for the week, and I can all but assure you they’ll be nothing but compost fodder when you get back to them–and that’s IF you can find em, which I doubt.\n\nPLEASE: DON’T BRING PLANTS TO THE PLAYA.\n\nSorry to shout, but wanted to make sure that’s clear. A plant on the playa is like a dog or small child, but one that can’t communicate. They don’t belong. Hell, we don’t belong. But they don’t have a choice–you do.\n\nPlease, we’re on our hands and knees here, please don’t bring plants to the playa.",
