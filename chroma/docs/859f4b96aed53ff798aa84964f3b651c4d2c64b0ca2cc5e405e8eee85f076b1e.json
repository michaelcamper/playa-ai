  "content": "Since Monday, Burning Man participants have been enjoying and interacting with the products of artistic labor from around the world. They’ve been animating fish, receiving gifts or just meeting the builders in the shade of their temporary art. You can even get brisket and margaritas at the Houston CORE structure while dancing to the music they are spinning.\n\nAt night the pieces glow with colored or animated light, showing participants a new face.\n\nDay and night, morning and evening, the area where the CORE projects stand are buzzing with activity. Below are many images of the activity around the CORE projects, as well as photos of the completed artwork by these dedicated builders.\n\nThese are the last images most will see before all of these structures are ignited in unison at a massive Thursday night burn. The night play ends at dawn and the CORE teams prep their wood for the final display in flames.",
