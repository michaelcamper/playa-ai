We are looking for seasoned and brand new performers to join us on the Midway; both stages will be curated and scheduled. Performers are encouraged to sign up prior to Burning Man, as time slots will fill up fast. You will not be provided a ticket to Burning Man for performing, you will need to have ticket in hand.\n\nFor more information, or to sign up now, email stagemanager-at-burningman.org.",
