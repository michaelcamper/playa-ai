  "content": "I went to our local Earth Day festival and gave out FREE HUGS.\n\nI didn’t intend for it to be a Burning Man-related activity. It certainly wasn’t my intention to preach the Principles. But that is what happened.\n\nI stood there with a pink “HUGS” sign above my head. Some people ignored me, some smiled and walked on by, but quite a few gave me big ol’ hugs.\n\nBut what was most surprising to me was how many people could not understand why I was doing it.\n“Who are you here representing? What are you promoting?”\n\n“I’m not selling anything! Just Gifting hugs.”\n\nThey gave me looks of bewilderment.\n\nOne guy even shoved money in my hand…as if I was painted silver doing the robot.\n\nI am so immersed in Burning Man culture that it did not occur to me how foreign a non-transactional interaction is to most people.\n\nOnce they realized I didn’t have some angle, I was struck by the profound appreciation people expressed. People lit up when they started to grok that this was Gifting. I was reminded of how transformative the 10 Principles (and specifically Gifting) can be for people…and the world.\n\nWe are Black Rock City Citizens for 1 week a year. We are Ambassadors the other 51.",
