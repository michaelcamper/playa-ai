  "content": "The UK’s BBC Radio 1 got brave, and sent Bobby Friction, one of their on-air DJs, across the pond to attend Burning Man for the first time in 2009, and to record his experience along the way. It’s fun to ride along with Bobby as he’s transfixed and transformed by the playa, Black Rock City, and Burners, while learning what Burning Man is all about.\n\nYou can listen to his podcast here.  (Note: it contains language that might offend some listeners.)",
