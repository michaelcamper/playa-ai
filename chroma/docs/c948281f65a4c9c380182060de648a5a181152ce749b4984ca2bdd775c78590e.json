  "content": "It’s July 31, and I’m still seein’ posts on Facebook about “Lake Lahontan” on the Black Rock playa. I grew weary of the “Better bring your kayak to Burning Man this year!” comments back in April.\n\nHere are the facts.\n\nThe playa is dry. Lake Lahontan has evaporated to the heavens. The final conclusions drawn from dozens of soil samples taken and months of scientific data collected is that ultimately, conditions of the playa surface and integrity are no different than any year in the past, regardless of the close-to-record-breaking rain and snowfall of this last winter. The water is gone, and the fairy shrimp have left the building.\n\nPack your bags. Black Rock City 2017 awaits!\n\nGranted, it was a nail-biter for a while. But, personally, I think this is a healthy thing. I can almost hear a “gotcha!” blowing on the breezes as the playa smugly smiles.\n\nA much-anticipated meeting happened on July 21. The experts and deciders at the Bureau of Land Management, guardians of the beloved Black Rock Desert, assembled with the experts and deciders for Black Rock City. One thing we all shared was the desire to see the Burning Man event transpire as normal — normal for us, anyway. And it shall. Our event has always had a rugged front, and we’ve slogged through the dust and mud before. When Black Rock City gets a white-out dust storm, people fly kites.\n\nSo grab your blinky lights and goggles, your box wine, beer and bacon, and spin the steering wheel toward the high Nevada desert. And always remember what the Grinch said when he gave back Christmas —\n\n“It came! It came just the same!”\n\nTop photo by Audrey Whaling",
