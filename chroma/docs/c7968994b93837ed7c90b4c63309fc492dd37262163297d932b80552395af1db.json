  "content": "Greetings Burners, dreamers, creators, cultural instigators, and community builders!\n\nWhether or not we’re able to return to the physical Black Rock City this year, we are excited to announce that we are once again working with visionary creators and technologists in our community to build a constellation of Virtual Burning Man Experiences for 2021 we’re calling the Virtual Burn.\n\nThese radically inclusive, virtual Burning Man worlds will invite anybody with an internet connection, anywhere in the world, to contribute to the creativity, community and culture we so enjoy, whether they’re using a virtual reality headset, a desktop computer or a mobile device.\n\nMore than 165,000 people participated in the Multiverse virtual offerings in 2020. These whimsical, interactive, and awe-inspiring worlds played host to Burners (and Burn-curious) from around the world, who discovered that Burning Man is more than a place; it’s an opportunity to engage deeply with others through authentic connections around a shared passion for Radical Self-expression.\n\nThe remarkably inventive teams behind the 2020 worlds are reigniting them for 2021, building out bigger, richer, and more interactive environments to play, collaborate, celebrate, and participate in meaningful (and yes, digital!) Virtual Burn experiences.\n\nWe are over the moon to announce the virtual worlds participating this year:\n\nAnd, as has been the case since it went online in 2007, you can drop in and check out Burning Man’s long-running virtual Regional community, BURN2.\n\nHow to Participate\n\nReady to jump in and contribute as an artist, developer or volunteer? Get started by filling in our participation form!\n\nAs always, YOU are encouraged to bring your imagination, your enthusiasm, and your mad skills to help bring the Virtual Burn to vibrant life. Just like Black Rock City, Virtual Burning Man Experiences are created by participants who gift art installations, Mutant Vehicles, theme camps, performances, and events to the greater community — and we all benefit. Whether or not you have technical experience, you can play a part!\n\nThere’s more to come — in the meantime, consider how you want to play, then dive in and participate in building this year’s amazing Virtual Burn.",
