  "content": "The Low Income Ticket Program for Burning Man 2013 is now accepting applications!\n\nThe Low Income Ticket program provides 4,000 tickets (at $190 each) — while supplies last — to those who provide proof of financial hardship. Our Ticketing department reviews each application and awards tickets to those who are best able to demonstrate need. Applicants should receive a response within 4-6 weeks of submitting their application. These tickets are non-transferrable and must be purchased and picked up at Will Call in Black Rock City.\n\nVisit our ticketing page for information about how to apply. We will announce via the Jackrabbit Speaks Newsletter when these tickets are gone.\n\nGood luck!\n\nUPDATE (4/15/13): The 2013 Low Income Ticket program is no longer accepting applications. The process of reviewing applications and awarding tickets is still in progress.",
