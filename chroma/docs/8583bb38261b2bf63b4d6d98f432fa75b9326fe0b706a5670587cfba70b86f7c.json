  "content": "Hi everybody!\n\nA couple of things that may help you tomorrow (that’s Wednesday, February 26, starting at 12:00 noon PST) during the Individual Sale.\n\nYour best bet for getting into the sale easily is to use the unique link that was in your confirmation email. If that’s not possible for you, you’ll want to use the button that will appear on the top of tickets.burningman.com (note: this will require you to manually enter your unique access code during the purchase process.). Lastly, you can always access your information in your Burner Profile, but be forewarned that this system can’t handle quite the capacity of the ticketing system.\n\nWe know you’re eager, but clicking the link before 12pm (noon) PST on Wednesday, February 26 will only give you an error message, so try to be patient and wait for noon. Not sure when 12pm (noon) PST is in your timezone? Here’s a handy timezone calculator.\n\nAlso know that during the purchase process you will be requested to either sign in to or register a Ticketfly account. It will not recognize your Burner Profile username and password (though we are working to make that a reality in the future). Even if you have a pre-existing Ticketfly account, please create a new one using the same email address as you’ve listed in your Burner Profile.\n\nThanks and happy ticketing!",
