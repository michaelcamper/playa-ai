  "content": "My friend Sarah and I just published a story called 24 Hours At The Temple Of Juno.\n\nGuess what it’s about.\n\nTo get you hot and bothered, here’s a little excerpt:\n\nYeah. That’s what we thought then. Wanna see what happens next?\n\nIt’s available from TempleStories.com as an illustrated text and a SoundCloud podcast. You can listen along, or you can download the audio and listen at your leisure. You’ll want to listen; it includes some sounds of Home.\n\nOur deepest thanks to those of you who responded to our call for submissions. We included three of your contributions in our story. And this is just the beginning. Now that our first Temple story is live, we will collect more of them and share them on the Temple Stories blog. We encourage you to submit your stories to us at blog.templestories.com/submit.\n\nRemember, it’s not just about the Temple at Burning Man. It’s about temples everywhere. Wherever you find a sacred spot in your community, keep your eyes and ears open for good stories. If you find them, share them with us. If you need help crafting your story, we’ll help you.\n\nWe welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions. Email us at us {{at}} templestories.com.\n\nYou can find us on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Google+.\n\nEternal thanks to Scott London and Rod Hoekstra for sharing some amazing photographs with us.",
