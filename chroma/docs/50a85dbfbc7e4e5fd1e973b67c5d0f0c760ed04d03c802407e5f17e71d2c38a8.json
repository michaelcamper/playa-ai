  "content": "When the NorCal fires swept through in the middle of the night on October 8, 2017, thousands of people fled for their lives in an attempt to get out in front of the quick moving fires fueled by hurricane force winds. With flames barreling down on them, many people took the time to knock on their neighbor’s doors and alert them of the impending danger. The situation was chaotic and confusing with emergency personnel completely overwhelmed. Once the smoke had cleared, 44 people lost their lives, 20,000 people were displaced with over 5,000 homes destroyed in Santa Rosa alone. Before the fires, the region had a 1% rental vacancy rate, which meant there was nowhere for the survivors to go.\n\nLee Merschon was watching the situation unfold from his home in Los Angeles and realized that the sleeping containers and kitchen container from his Burning Man theme camp (Camp Epic) had stored in Reno would be needed to help house 80 people and enable people to stay in the area. The containers arrived in Santa Rosa three weeks after the fires.\n\nFor the following four months, volunteers worked hundreds of hours to raise funds and acquire the building permits that would allow uninsured fire survivors to get out of their cars and have a safe space to live while they regrouped. Despite the desire of fire survivors and many city officials, Oasis Village was not able to open due to the lack of permitting regulations in place for temporary housing as well as a lack of funding from the $50 million community relief fund.\n\nWhile we didn’t achieve our originally intended impact, like most projects, we learned a lot in the process and are reminded that projects like this are a prototype and while not all prototypes succeed, they provide essential learning opportunities. In the spirit of Burning Man and Burners Without Borders, we attempted something new and innovative. And while Oasis Village wasn’t able to open, we know that the adjacent successes, lessons learned and the inspiration that comes from the story lives on.\n\nWe would like to share what was learned while on the ground attempting this project. Our intention is to enable communities to be better prepared for future disasters.\n\nIf you’re interested in continuing to stay up to date with Burners Without Borders through our website, newsletter, and global volunteer group.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the Oasis Village Project",
