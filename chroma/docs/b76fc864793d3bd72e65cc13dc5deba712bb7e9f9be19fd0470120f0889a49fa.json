  "content": "We got a little more playa-fied on Tuesday. We went over to the Black Rock Boutique to get some fancy new duds.\n\nA group of Burners from Portland have been setting up shop here for years, helping new and veteran Burners find the look they want.\n\nWe ran into Cobra Commander and Phoenix Firestarter waiting in line.  “I just ask them for something dark and threatening,” Cobra said.\n\nWe didn’t find much in the way of dark OR threatening inside, but there was plenty to choose from  nevertheless.  Perhaps a blue gingham dress with white apron? Umm, no. Too domestic. Wrong message.\n\nIn the end, three of us emerged with our new threads, happy and transformed. Everyone who visits the boutique must exit via a fashion-show ramp on the outside of the tent. There’s blaring music, and you dance down the runway, and if you’re lucky, there are cheers and whistles from those waiting in line for their turn.",
