  "content": "Some of you may be familiar with one of Burning Man’s origin stories, about a party house in the Bay Area known only by its address — 1907 Golden Gate. Gatherings in its redwood salon during the late 1980s and early 1990s brought together members of the Cacophony Society, as well as some people who happened to be burning a Man down on Baker Beach. It was in this house that a handful of instigators hatched a plan to bring Burning Man from San Francisco to the Black Rock Desert.\n\nThis art story has its source in a present-day equivalent: a community called the 706. Originating around 2013 in a student dwelling in Beijing, apartment 706 nurtured a community of young people who communed, explored, and hatched new projects. From that one apartment, dozens of 706 communities emerged. Today you’ll find them throughout China, and around the world.\n\nMeet Eva Yunqi Wei, a San Francisco-based architect and artist who is bringing an installation to Black Rock City in collaboration with the 706 community. Eva is the lead artist for “Respirator,” which she describes as a “living embodiment of the playa’s respiratory system.” Built from a transparent cube structure, openings in the cube will inspire “Respirator” to pulsate, breathe and interact with the wind and surrounding environment.\n\nParticipants will be able to step inside to experience the wind squeeze from different directions, akin to forces that shaped the ancient playa. At night, illuminated fabric will reveal multi-colored chambers that resemble the alveoli of a living lung.\n\nWe spoke with Eva to learn about the inspiration behind “Respirator” and her roots in the 706 community.\n\nI would love to hear your Burning Man story. How did you get inspired to go to Black Rock City in the first place?\n\nEva: 2022 was my first burn. Initially, Burning Man to me seemed like a gathering of peculiar people dressed oddly, camping in the middle of nowhere, going without showers for seven days. However, as I delved deeper into it, I realized it was much more than that. From the 10 Principles I can feel a radical aspiration to create a utopia on Earth.\n\nIt was a transformative experience filled with countless eye-opening moments. The desert itself left a lasting impression on me. The dust storms, the mountains in the far back, and the vast sky remind me of a famous poem that I know from my childhood, by a Tang Dynasty poet who was stationed in the frontier at that time:\n\nIt describes a scene that resonated with what I saw, even more than a thousand years later.\n\nTell us about “Respirator.” What is the inspiration behind it? How does the metaphor of the body and breath express an aspect of being on playa?\n\nThe playa is like a living being, with an unpredictable temperament that changes from one moment to the next. That inspired me to create an art installation that captures its essence — a piece that is light, amorphous, and in constant flux, just like the swirling sandstorms that dance across the playa.\n\nRespirator is a 10’x10’x10 cube. Its transparent cube structure acts as both its protective skin and a display of its inner workings to the world. The cube’s openings serve as pores, allowing the wind to blow through and interact with the installation. The bubble is made out of soft fabric. Whenever the wind blows through, it takes on a different shape with the force of nature, like the breath of the desert.\n\nIt captures your eyes and invites you to pause and feel the wild breath of the land. It also invites visitors to step inside, which offers a more intimate encounter. As the wind permeates the bubble from various directions, it creates a tactile and sensory experience. Each breath taken within aligns with the frequency of the playa, forging a connection to the original heartbeat of the land.\n\nWhat kind of fabric are you seeking to create that breathing effect?\n\nOur ideal fabric needs to be lightweight, allowing it to move and respond to the wind easily. It should also be flexible, enabling it to stretch as needed. At the same time, it should be sturdy enough to withstand the windy conditions on the playa.\n\nCurrently, we are in the process of conducting fabric tests to find the best option. One that shows promise is the high-temperature pleated fabric, known for its use by Issey Miyake.\n\nWhen tension is applied to the fabric, its pleats create a stretching effect that mimics the desired breathing effect, to some extent. We acknowledge the challenge of replicating the unique environment of the playa in the Bay Area. It is difficult to achieve an “amorphous” art piece without the same conditions on the playa. We have to deal with a lot of uncertainties.\n\nWe are actively seeking advice from professionals in the field of textile artwork. If there are individuals experienced in this area and interested in our project, please reach out to us: yunqi06102032@gmail.com.\n\nYou said you observed a lack of Chinese representation in Black Rock City. Tell me a bit about that and how it inspired you to create and bring art.\n\nIn 2022 I joined an art tour where we explored a diverse range of artworks. On that tour we saw beautiful installations by artists from various countries around the world, but I didn’t see one by a Chinese artist. This is the first time I felt a strong inclination to contribute.\n\nInitially, I hesitated because I’m not a professional artist; I had no prior experience and had only been to the playa once. However, I eventually pushed myself to take on this challenge, realizing that the first attempt may not be perfect. It became more than just creating art. It became a way to inspire others in our community.\n\nWe want to show that even without prior experience or considering oneself an artist, anyone can contribute and receive support. Through this, I hope to see an increase in the representation of Chinese artwork on the playa.\n\nI was inspired by my peers too. One of my campmates from 2022 created a small piece called “The Conversation Collector.” It consisted of a post with a button. When they pressed the button, people were prompted to share a story, which the piece recorded. This gave me a glimpse into the process of bringing art to the playa and encouraged me to do it myself.\n\nCan you tell me a bit about your community, 706. How did the 706 community connect or get involved with Burning Man culture?\n\nSure. I am part of a passionate team of artists, architects, programmers and creators who share a common connection through our community known as 706. In 2022 we brought our camp to BRC, called 706 Tribe.\n\nThe 706 North America is currently a nonprofit organization in the US. It originally started in Beijing when a bunch of college students decided to rent an apartment right next to their university as a space for meetups and gatherings. That apartment quickly became a center for a wide range of activities, including lectures, debate, literature groups, political discussions, music jams, and everything. And the name, 706, was the unit number of that apartment.\n\nI was lucky enough to crash at that place for a couple of weeks during my college days, and I met a diverse group of individuals who expanded my perspective on life and enriched my understanding of different cultures. Unfortunately, due to various circumstances, the original space had to close down. But the idea behind the community resonated with those who had been part of it, and they have been working to spread that concept worldwide.\n\nThe 706 community has since expanded globally in a decentralized manner. Similar to Regional Burning Man communities, local 706 communities have emerged in different cities around the world, including the Bay Area where I am currently located. Even though each local community operates in their own unique ways, we share the same values, which I think coincide with the spirit of Burning Man. We embrace the spirit of collaboration, creativity and connection, encouraging expression, understanding and inclusion, and always exploring the possibilities of alternative lifestyles.\n\nHow can we support “Respirator”? Anything you want to add?\n\nWe are a small group and we greatly appreciate your support in bringing “Respirator” to life! You can show your support by making a donation on Givebutter. As 706 North America is a 501(c)(3) organization, your donation will be eligible for a tax refund. The funds we raise will be used to acquire the necessary materials and equipment to complete “Respirator,” as well as to promote and share the project with a wider audience. I invite you to follow @respirator_art on Instagram, where we share updates and behind-the-scenes moments.\n\nLastly, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my team, my partner, and everyone who has contributed and supported me and this project. In the beginning, it was just me working on this solo, and I couldn’t have imagined how to create a 10-foot art piece and bring it to the desert all by myself. But with all of you, it’s becoming true. It has already been a rewarding journey for me, and I believe it will continue all the way to the playa.",
