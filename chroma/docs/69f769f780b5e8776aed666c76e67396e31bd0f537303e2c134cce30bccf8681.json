  "content": "In our ongoing effort to reduce car traffic to the event and encourage alternative transportation, we’re selling 1,000 Burner Express Bus Plus tickets beginning June 14 at 12 pm (noon) Pacific Time. Burner Express Bus Plus tickets include the option to buy a $425 ticket to the event.\n\nIf you want to take Burner Express Bus to Black Rock City and haven’t already purchased an event ticket this is your chance! You can buy a Burner Express Bus Plus ticket by logging into your Burner Profile and clicking a link that will appear at 12 (noon) Pacific Time. If you have already purchased Burning Man tickets, you will not be able to purchase another event ticket via the Burner Express Bus Plus sale.\n\nOnce you purchase your Burner Express Bus Plus ticket, you will receive a payment link via email for your Burning Man event ticket. You will need to pay for your Burning Man ticket before July 19 at 12pm (noon) PDT. You’ll pick it up at the point of embarkation in San Francisco or Reno when you check in for your bus.\n\nThat’s worth repeating: Burner Express Bus Plus is a Burner Express Bus ticket plus an opportunity to buy a $425 (plus fees and taxes) Burning Man event ticket for your use in conjunction with your bus ticket. The event ticket is only valid if you ride the Burner Express Bus — you cannot use the ticket to enter Black Rock City via any other method of transportation.\n\nImportant tip: Burner Express Bus Plus tickets only allow for entry into BRC on Monday, Aug. 28 through Thursday, Aug. 31. You won’t be able to use a BxB+ ticket to arrive any time before Monday.  Once you’ve got your Burner Express Bus Plus ticket, visit the Burner Express Bus website on June 15 or after to book your return trip, bike ticket and luggage and water add ons.\n\nIf you have additional questions about Burner Express Bus Plus tickets, please see the Ticket Support page. (Don’t email ticketing! Do what the page says!)\n\nAlready have a ticket? You can still take the Burner Express Bus!\n\nIf you already have a Burning Man ticket (or expect to get one before the event)  you can still book a trip on Burner Express Bus with departures from downtown San Francisco and Reno-Tahoe International Airport to Black Rock City  from  Saturday, August 26 through Thursday, August 31.\n\nNew for 2017: Since last year was a resounding success, we will offer water sales and entry on Saturday pre-event without a Work Access Pass again.\n\nBurner Express Bus tickets can be purchased on the Burner Express website. You must have a valid Burning Man ticket, Will Call confirmation number, or other valid entry credential to board a Burner Express Bus. A Burner Express bus ticket alone will not allow you to enter Black Rock City.\n\nPro tips:\n\nTake the time to read the FAQ before you buy your tickets. This will eliminate any questions you may have during the buying process and help your buying experience go smoothly.",
