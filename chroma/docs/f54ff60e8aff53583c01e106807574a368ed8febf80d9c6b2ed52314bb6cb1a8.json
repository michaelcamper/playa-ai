  "content": "Tutu Tuesday rolled slowly along yesterday, with strolling bands of Participants passing, showing off their finest Tutus. The weather cooled slightly after an oppressively hot day as clouds moved in suddenly and brought us our first whiteout of the event. It was a good reminder for everyone that yes, you are in the middle of the desert.\n\nGone are the days of pointing your bike towards wherever you had to go to work or eat and just sight lining it there. Now you move through blocks of camps past thousands of Participants dressed in all manner of Burning Man fashion. Folks have definitely moved in and acclimated to the climate. Shelter is up and secure (and some structures failed the big wind, to be rebuilt stronger afterwards) folks are unpacked and hydrated, and all over the City, sudden smells and irregular odd sounds that back home would signal danger, have become just as ambient as the drone of generators and the thumping of music.\n\nI worked a few shifts at Eggs Bar across from Recycle Camp. We ID everyone who comes through, and when we get any attitude, I let them know that they have to understand these two weeks are our biggest weeks of the year. We can’t be shut down during Burning Man. The rest of the year it’s slow out here, with the occasional hunters or rocket guys, possibly some desert tourists, but these two weeks matter to us. And we appreciate your business.\n\nThe Artstipation we may have been experiencing earlier has passed and the playa is overflowing with completed projects. The only remaining projects we hope are “plop and play”, requiring little assistance from Art Support Services. The Keyhole piece “Bloom” is up and lit at night after experiencing some setbacks. Using stained glass in projects out here is challenging as Matt Schultz who brought “The Whale” last year can attest. Matt was over at Eggs Bar the other day and wanted people to know that when they visit “The Pier” they should ask about the top level of Pappy’s Master Bait shop, Pappy’s Bistro. It’s fine dining and very exclusive, serving noodle and con frites. Come for the noodles, stay for the snark.\n\nWe’ve also heard that there is an app called “Poop Scoop” that tracks all the porta-potties on playa this year complete with a map that uses geo-location, reviews of each porta with a big thumbs up or down, and push messaging to let you know when they’ve been serviced. You can download it here. Also, just a rumor – the ATMs will be arriving tomorrow at Center Camp, at Greeters and at some of the bars in town. You don’t actually need money in Black Rock City, but, like your phones that you obsessively lovingly cradle even now that it’s basically a brick camera since the gates opened, accessing an ATM is a creature comfort.\n\nIf you’re coming in on Tuesday, Danger Ranger will be speaking at the “Founders Series” at Mansonian at 8:00 pm at 6:45 and Awe. The next two nights will feature a special guest who will talk about Fire on Wednesday at 8 and Harley Dubois will talk on Thursday about the Untold Stores and Unsung Heroes of Burning Man. Also Tubadour is playing his flaming tuba daily at the Mansonian Man museum, now complete with real artifacts.\n\nThe ARTery is hosting “ART SPEAKS” Wednesday through Friday from 2:00 – 3:30 with various artists who have art out here this year talking about their pieces. The ARTery at the Everywhere/ARTery Pavilion, on the Esplanade at 6:30.\n\nAnd people, don’t vandalize or try to break the art. WTF is wrong with you? To the 99% of Black Rock City citizens who aren’t dumbasses, please feel empowered to tell people who are participating in such jackassery to stop. In addition to all the new art, we’ve got a kind of greatest hits with some pieces you may have never seen before. As Matt said, “We’ve gotten the band back together”. Enjoy the art.\n\nIf you aren’t here yet, get out here. Our population is growing rapidly and the City is coming alive. Drive carefully and see you soon.",
