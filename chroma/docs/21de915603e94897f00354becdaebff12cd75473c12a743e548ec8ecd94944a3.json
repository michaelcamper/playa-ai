  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is back with a second season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS02 E05 – It Was Cold & It Was Very Blinky Out.\n\nBurning Man’s Publisher, Jon (Editor’s note: Hi.), calls in to Accuracy Third from Israel, because that’s where he is. D-Day, Rex, & Beth hear a bit about Israel’s Regional Burn, Midburn, before we delve into the inner workings of the seasonal nature of being a Burning Man employee. Believe it or not, they’ve got a nonstandard corporate culture there. We also get a great story on how Black Rock City is objectively better than the streets of San Francisco, plus you’ll hear how you can get your very own job with the Burning Man Organization (Editor’s note: Uh, maybe?).\n\nS02 E06 – Hippies Don’t Have Addresses\n\nA couple of stories today: Phil tells us all about being adjacent to an iconic moment of Burning Man photography. Knettles & Pants, gentlemen hoboes, talk us through setting off on a year-long quest of being stinky and traveling around. Also, D-Day doesn’t know about Burning Man, and Malört tastes like earwax.\n\nS03 E07 – Is it your story?\n\nIt could be! Send your story ideas to accuracythird@gmail.com, or find us on the social internets! Don’t forget to subscribe, rate, or review us wherever you get your podcasts.",
