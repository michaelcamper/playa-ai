  "content": "Please join us at Burning Man HQ for an evening of lively discussion focused on building community through group living arrangements.\n\nBuilding Community Through Cooperative Living\nWhen:  Thursday, April 17th, 7-9pm\nWhere:  Burning Man HQ, 660 Alabama, San Francisco, CA\n\nCooperative living arrangements have been popular in the U.S. for decades. These arrangements take many forms, from low-income options, such as squatter warehouses and affordable housing co-ops, to those requiring more capital, such as resident-designed cohousing developments. Faced with increasing home prices, the rise of the ‘sharing economy’, and a renewed focus on the importance of human connection, individuals are turning to cooperative living environments across the Bay Area and beyond.\n\nThis panel will bring together Burners from a range of cooperative living situations to talk about their experiences—the benefits, the challenges, and the cultural consequences of creating and living in shared spaces. Our panelists will explore what it is about cooperative living they find compelling, and what elements are important in building vibrant community.\n\nPlease RSVP HERE\n\nPanelists:\nRaines Cohen, East Bay Cohousing\nNicole Sawaya, Project Artaud\nJT Yu, Cooperative Roots\nJessy Kate Schingler, Open Door Development Group\n\nThis program is part of an ongoing series of events produced as part of the non-profit Burning Man Project’s Educational Program, supporting its cultural, philosophical and educational initiatives around the world.
