  "content": "Back when I got extremely drunk with a high ranking member of BMIR’s leadership team, I was specifically asked to prepare a PSA about how to handle traffic at Burning Man.\n\nThe first thing I learned is: Don’t drink and write a PSA. They’ll just accuse you of setting a bad example. But goddammit, I don’t have a problem, the Interstate Highway System has a problem! Have you seen how crooked those roads are? There’s only one way to cross a mountain, and that’s to go through it!\n\nFor the rest of my tips about how to handle traffic at Burning Man, listen below:\n\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\nOr click here.\n\nEnjoy! And if there’s a topic you’d like me to produce a PSA for, drop me a line. Or actually don’t. It’s pretty close to Burning Man and I haven’t done any preparation yet. Do you think I’ll need a tent?\n\nCaveat is the Volunteer Coordinator for Media Mecca at Burning Man. His opinions are in no way statements of the Burning Man organization.
