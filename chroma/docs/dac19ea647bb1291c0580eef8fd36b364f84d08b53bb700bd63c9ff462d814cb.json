As the event draws to a close, the burning of wood at the Burn Gardens increases dramatically due to participants eager to burn their excess wood. The main challenge is dealing with participants who try to overstack the burn platforms, as well as burn inappropriate materials such as trash, compost, and recycling.\n\nStarting Sunday morning 9/1/13 at 9am The Burn Garden Wood Donation Team will make sure that participants do not overstack the burn platforms or burn inappropriate materials. Burning Man is proud to be the largest practicing Leave No Trace Event in the world and participants need to take their trash, recycling, and compost with them.\n\nAdditionally, the team will facilitate the collection of Wood Donations where participants can donate good quality, useable lumber. The donors will be doing most of the heavy lifting, you just need to direct them.\n\n3-person team per Burn Garden\n2-hour shifts\nSimple:)\n\nFor More Info: BURN GARDEN INFO AND SHIFT SIGN UP HERE\n\nThank you! See you in the dust!\nFor any issues with Shiftboard Sign Ups contact: emerald@burningman.com",
