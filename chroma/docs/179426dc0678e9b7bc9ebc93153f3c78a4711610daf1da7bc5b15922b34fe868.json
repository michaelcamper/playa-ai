  "content": "Please join us for this special discussion on December 12 at Burning Man Headquarters!\n\nCrowdfunding: Trends in the Sharing Economy\n\nThe sharing economy is taking off – whether it’s peer-to-peer rentals, skill sharing, crowdfunding, ridesharing or unused parking spots. Spawned by a confluence of the economic crisis, environmental concerns, and the social web coming of age, the sharing economy is quickly becoming the hottest trend in economic paradigms.\n\nWe in the Burning Man community are particularly interested in the dynamics and the future of the sharing economy, since it reflects our principles of gifting, communal effort, civic responsibility and decommodification.\n\nPlease join us for a panel discussion focused specifically on the future of crowdfunding, one of the fastest-developing areas in the sharing economy. We will explore the role it plays in creative community development, and how it’s being applied to entrepreneurial endeavors in the form of spaces (local real estate) and support for small businesses (micro loans).\n\nWhen: December 12, 7-9pm\nWhere: Burning Man HQ\nAddress: 660 Alabama Street, San Francisco\n\nPanelists:\nDaniel Miller, Fundrise\nHarry Pottash, Kiva\nKate Drane, Indiegogo\n\nModerator:\nWill Chase, Burning Man Project\n\nPlease RSVP to attend.\n\nThis program is part of an ongoing series of events produced as part of the non-profit Burning Man Project’s Educational Program, supporting its cultural, philosophical and educational initiatives around the world.
