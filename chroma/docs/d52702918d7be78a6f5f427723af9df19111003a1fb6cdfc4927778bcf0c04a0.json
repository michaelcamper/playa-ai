Hoo boy, this should be fun.\n\nFrom Mike with the BLM: “It should start about 1:00 to 12:00 PM on the 27th and end about 3:AM on the 28th. We will be able to see the entire eclipse at the Burning Man event. This will be the first ever total lunar eclipse at the event.\n\nHere is a link to a site that explains the timing of the total lunar eclipse.”\n\nAnd if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear\nYou shout and no one seems to hear.\nAnd if the band you’re in starts playing different tunes\nI’ll see you on the dark side of the moon….",
