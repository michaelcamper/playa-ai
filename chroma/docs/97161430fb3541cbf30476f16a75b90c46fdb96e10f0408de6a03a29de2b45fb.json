  "content": "With the Bay Lights as a glittering backdrop, the Flaming Lotus Girls  have installed their beautiful and interactive 2009 sculpture, “Soma”, at Pier 14.\n\nSan Francisco has been showcasing art at Pier 14 for a while now and Soma is the third art piece to have debuted in Black Rock City that will now grace this breathtaking corner of the City.  The piece was installed over the last two weeks and has already become the toast of San Francisco.\n\nThe sculpture is 60 ft long, dendrite to dendrite “depicting two communicating neurons connected by an axon bridge.  A soma is the cell body of a neuron, with branching dendrites projecting away at different angles, and an axon which conducts the nerve signal electrochemically to its neighboring cell.”\n\nSoma is the combined work of over 100 Flaming Lotus Girls volunteers and the fire that glowed on the playa has been replaced with 97 LED lights that mix wonderfully with Leo Villareal’s Bay Lights behind them.\n\nThe  Flaming Lotus Girl’s Soma site describes Soma as a sculpture that\n\nThe Black Rock Arts Foundation  was instrumental in collaborating with the Flaming Lotus Girls to have the piece installed at Pier 14.\n\nMedia coverage has included KPIX, SFGate and SFIst.\n\nSoma was built at the Boxshop and has been installed at the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, Black Rocky City, and at San Mateo, California’s  Maker Faire.  The Flaming Lotus Girls,  some original Soma builders and a bunch of new people – a few who were personally touched by Soma on the playa, worked for just under two years from proposal to completion, to bring Soma to the Embarcadero.  The process involved a lot of re-fabrication of the sculpture including the removal of fire, changing out all the LEDs,  adding new resin and UV-resistant  bulbs, then waterproofing the whole thing and making the piece City and “public” safe.   (Please do not climb on the sculpture!)  There are two buttons that allow participants to interact with the LEDs that are active from dusk until 2am.\n\nIt required a lot of work and money to make Soma  City ready and if you would like to support this project, it would be greatly appreciated. You can go directly to Soma’s website or you can donate through the Black Rock Art’s Foundation at their Click and Pledge page.\n\nThe Flaming Lotus Girls are throwing a Soma@Pier 14 – A Cerebral Celebration, August 1st to celebrate the installation.",
