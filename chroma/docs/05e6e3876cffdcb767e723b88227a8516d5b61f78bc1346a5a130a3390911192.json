The BLM is in town, and we’ve scheduled our site inspection for tomorrow morning. Will the weather hold? Will the playa be passable? Will Burning Man happen next year? It all comes down to tomorrow!\n\nToday, I’ve got the last scores from the 2011 MOOP Map. In Day Nine, your DPW Playa Restoration team swept through Center Camp, then began systematically cleaning some of Black Rock City’s busiest and MOOPiest spots. We covered the inner playa and the art sites, work camps and roads, and kept working until this Tuesday when the weather closed in, and we had to leave the desert behind.\n\nToday’s score is a mixed bag, and the results may surprise you:\n\nNOTE: THIS IS NOT THE FINAL MOOP MAP FOR 2011. We still have a few hot spots to map, and we’ll be double-checking all the data before we release a full, complete and high-resolution map for you to review. At that time, we’ll tell you how to get in touch with us if you have questions. That’ll all be in a few weeks, so keep your shirts on ’til then!\n\nYou MOOP Map experts will notice immediately that Center Camp scored extremely well this year. It’s over 90% green: greener than ever before! However, you’ll also see a new black spot where the Temple of Transition once stood. That’s unfortunate, especially considering that both sites had equally high levels of traffic. Yet Center Camp gets greener and greener, while the Temple is traditionally one of the MOOPiest areas.\n\nWhat’s the difference? It all comes down to the LNT plan. Representatives from the Temple crew came out to help Restoration workers clean their site, but ultimately they just didn’t have the resources and people to manage all the MOOP themselves.\n\nMakes you think, MOOP lovers: How much did the Temple mean to you this year? How about your favorite sound camp? Will YOU chip in and help your favorite installations clean up next year?\n\nAll in all, the city scored very well this year — nearly as well as 2010, which was a record-breaker. 2011 saw an increase in Yellow zones, which is a bit of a disappointment considering the hard-packed playa surface this year. If your camp was marked Yellow or Red, work on your LNT plan for next year! There’s always room to improve, and every hour you spend MOOPing is one less man hour for the hardworking Restoration team.\n\nThe Golden T-Stake\n\nOn Tuesday, with a dust storm at our backs and dark clouds on the horizon, the Restoration crew gathered around Black Rock City’s last remaining T-stake. Coyote kicked off the ceremony with a few remarks about DPW’s history and honor, and then D.A. thanked the crew for kicking ass from August 1 to the bitter end.\n\nD.A. handed a stake puller to Weldboy, Line Boss #1 (and #1 Cool Dude), who attempted to read the Restoration crew the Ten Principles…\n\n…until he was attacked by dogs.\n\nSo he pulled the stake, and made a little speech instead.\n\nThen we all passed the stake from person to person, and we each said our piece, and all of us thought about how close we’ve become and how our lives have been changed by the incredible people around us.\n\nSuch as. Cobra Commander, DPW’s fearless leader…\n\nThe kitchen staff, who kept us fat and sassy with hundreds of pounds of bacon…\n\nFluffer Nipps, who delivered water and snacks to the work crews with a heapin’ helpin’ of attitude and the occasional nip slip…\n\nMr. Blue, who organized our recycling effort. We all helped by throwing cans at him…\n\nAnd then it was all over, and there was nothing left to clean up but our own crazy lives. Another season complete, another Restoration won, and we all sally forth in victory.\n\nBefore we can proclaim this year a clean win, Playa Restoration still needs to pass the championship round with the Bureau of Land Management refereeing. Show your home team some love, and tune in tomorrow to hear the results of our site inspection! ‘Til then, this is The Hun signing off.",
