We have been on volunteer teams together, I have seen her dance on a bar (one of those things you see in movies but donâ€™t really ever expect to see real people doing unless they are getting paid), and she sometimes lives in the world as a bunny. She sent me a little story the other day and asked if there were a way to get it posted on the Burning Blog. Well, who can say no to a bunny.",
