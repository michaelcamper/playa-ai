  "content": "There is still much to be figured out. And much to be learned.\nTons has been written about in comments and blogs. In addition to the official statement, Maid Marian spoke with NPR on Feb 9.\n\nFor the record, my intention is not to offer solutions to the situation – only to help see positive aspects of any situation – just like the Playa taught me. If my optimism has upset you, my apologies.\n\nHere is yet another installment of my thoughts on the 2012 Ticket Situation – including the story – & lessons – of “The Fall of Xara” at Burning Man 2000.\n\nAnd an extra video with a message for Burning Man Virgins:\n\n**NOTE: I AM NOT AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF BURNING MAN. I am merely a Participant with a passion for the event, people, and Principles of Burning Man. **\n\nNOTE:\nFeb 22 – Secure Ticket Exchange Program (STEP) opens\nMarch 28th – Open Sale (10,000 additional tickets)",
