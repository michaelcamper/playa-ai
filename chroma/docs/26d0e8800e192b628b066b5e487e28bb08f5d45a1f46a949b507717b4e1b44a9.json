  "content": "Close your eyes, open your mind, and explore your Waking Dreams, because the moment has arrived to create your designs for the 2022 Black Rock City stickers! It’s been waaaaay too long since we last got slap-happy with official BRC stickers, so I’m simply atingle to see what you all come up with.\n\nWait…what? You didn’t know? We don’t design all those stickers, YOU do. We just print a metric tonne of them and gift ‘em to all you lovely weirdos. So here’s your chance to share your very own self-adhesive work of art with the entire Black Rock City population. Each year we print many different designs; typically over a dozen submissions find their way to the playa.\n\nWe like variety! So go ahead and get weird…or existential…or abstract…or whatever your heart desires—these are YOUR stickers after all. You’re going to stick them all over your camp gear, car bumpers, friends… and who knows what else.\n\nFeel free to submit a couple different designs. Don’t forget, there is a theme (hint: it’s Waking Dreams); if your sticker has at least something to do with it, it’s more likely to get printed.\n\nOne more thing! Before you submit your design, please read through the requirements below. As much as you want that custom cut axolotl-shaped sticker to be printed, it simply won’t be. Sad face. (But totally print them yourself and find me on playa—axolotls are rad.)\n\nBlack Rock City 2022 Sticker Design Specs\n\nDesigner Tips\n\nSubmitting Your Art\n\nSticker Art Submission Deadline:\n\nWednesday, May 18, 2022. No art can be accepted after this date!\n\nP.S.\nDid you read the specs? Please read the specs.\nSay specs again.\nSpecs.",
