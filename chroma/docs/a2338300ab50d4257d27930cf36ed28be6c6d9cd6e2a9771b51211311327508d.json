  "content": "By the Coffee Shop Team\n\nCan you make a mean macchiato or pull shots like a pro? Or maybe you’re a whiz with moolah and making things run smoothly. Well, Center Camp Café may be just your cup of tea… coffee… hot chocolate.\n\nWe’re looking for more volunteers to help serve cuppas to our community during the event — and we welcome newbies too!\n\nAt Center Camp Café, our coffee counter is staffed with cashiers, experienced baristas, runners and brewers, and there are a huge range of little things that need doing.\n\nCashiers work at the counter, taking orders and making change. Baristas must have prior experience and be able to pull shots, steam milk and make all the variations of coffee on a standard machine.\n\nRunners keep things running smooth behind the counter, filling ice coolers, pouring the cold drinks and keeping the baristas stocked.\n\nIf you have yet to fill out the general purpose Burning Man Volunteer Questionnaire, please go to the Participation Portal — it’s the first step in signing up as a volunteer.\n\nAfter you submit that form, one or more teams within the Burning Man community (including the Coffee Shop) will be in touch with more specific details depending on what questions you have answered.\n\nIf you’ve already completed that form in the past and are familiar with the Shiftboard.com scheduling system, then hit us up at coffeeshop@burningman.org with a note about a membership check-up.\n\nBurning Man only happens because you and a host of other volunteers co-create this one-of-a-kind temporary community. And our efforts are driven by our love for the community that we serve and laugh and dance with 24/7! Every volunteer counts, so we look forward to counting you amongst them.\n\nTop photo: Center Camp Café (Photo by Philip Safarik)",
