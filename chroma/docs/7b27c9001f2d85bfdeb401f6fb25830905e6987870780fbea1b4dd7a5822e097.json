  "content": "It’s time for Phase 3 in the evolution of Sonic Runway. Surely you rode your bike through this thing on playa at least 11 times in 2016. After that, Rob Jensen and Warren Trezevant got a whole new version of Sonic Runway fabricated and installed in Chengdu, China. Now it’s coming to downtown San José, California as part of the city’s three-year-long Playa to Paseo arts initiative. The grand opening party will be held November 3.\n\nSonic Runway, as you may recall, is a tunnel of extremely blinky arches that converts audio signals into a pattern of lights that shoots down the tunnel at the speed of sound (1225 kph / 761 mph). From one end of the Runway, you can see the music racing away from you. On the other, you can see it coming at you and hear it reach you in sync with the patterns. The effect is pretty nuts. In San José, the Sonic Runway will be 432 feet long and stretch across two city blocks.\n\nBurning Man Project will offer a grant workshop in San José this October to share how to apply for Black Rock City Honoraria, which fund art going to the annual event in Nevada, or for Global Art Grant funding, which supports participatory art projects around the world. The artists will also host workshops covering topics including how to create art using the science of sound, working with steel, LED programming, and more. The City is also working with the South Bay Burners Regional Group and local artists, musicians, fashion designers, and performance companies to crank up the audible and visible volume in San José.\n\nHere’s the full press release:\n\nTop photo by Rob Jensen",
