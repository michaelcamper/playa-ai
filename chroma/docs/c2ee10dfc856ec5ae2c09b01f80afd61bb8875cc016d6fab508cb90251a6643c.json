  "content": "Aida sings to my daughter\nIn the dust-hazed desert\nSiren songs to my daughter\nSitting by her trashy trailer.\n\nOld costumes stuffed under the bed,\nA greasy stove and a pyramid of dishes in the sink\nRipe strawberries heaped in a pottery bowl\nAnd a maternal mantra.\n\nMy daughter roams the desert with Aida,\nBarefoot on the playa, nomadic and free.\nAida braids my daughterâ€™s hair with careless flowers\nSun-drunk, her mouth strawberry-stained.\n\nAida croons wanton lullabies by the black rock\nBanging on a tin drum with rusted rebar\nWhile the wind spins pretty zephyrs\nAnd my daughter claps her hands.\n\nAida and my daughter live in a floating world\nWith psychedelic sunsets\nAnd canopies of vagrant stars\nVast brilliant and heedless.\n\nHeedless of the filthy trailer\nHeedless of the rusted rebar\nHeedless of me.\nThey sing together in the desert,\nAida and my daughter,\nHeedless of me.\n\nby Judy Copek",
