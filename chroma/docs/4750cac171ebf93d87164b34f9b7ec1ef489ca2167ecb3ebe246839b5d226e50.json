  "content": "Hello out there all you MOOP maniacs and line sweepers extraordinaire! Here in the Black Rock Desert, your Playa Restoration team is in the final rounds of what has been a truly epic season. With just days left before we head back to the real world, we have swept throughout the Black Rock City grid, throughout the inner playa and up through the Man to the Temple. The pace has been quick and efficient, and the Restoration moopers have covered an impressive amount of ground.\n\nIt all comes down to next week, when the Bureau of Land Management arrives to inspect our site. Will we pass the inspection? Right now, it’s looking good, but the inspection is a strict examination of Burning Man’s Leave No Trace commitment; we never know what will happen until that moment of truth.\n\nWhat we do know so far is that the city is extremely clean this year. On Day 6, the Resto line sweeps made their way through the walk-in camping area, Black Rock City’s outer reaches where the population is scarce and the traffic scarcer. After a fast-paced half day with hardly any MOOP to be found, your Restoration All-Stars were driven off the playa by a cold, windy front closely followed by a heavy downpour. We welcomed a chance to get off our feet, retreat to the Black Rock Saloon and take a well-deserved day off.\n\nNext time, we’ll get a glimpse at the back streets of M and N, plus the Esplanade strip. I won’t lie to you: there’s a bit of rough road ahead. But as of Day 6, all is beautiful and green.\n\nREMEMBER: This is a work in progress, not the final map.\n\nGreen, clean, MOOP-free and beautiful. Thanks, walk-in campers, for always picking up your campsites and packing everything out. We love your work.\n\nTune in soon to find out what we discovered along the Esplanade, plus a glimpse of the back blocks on the 9:00 side of the city. It’s coming up real soon on MOOP Map Live 2013!\n\nSee more photos from Playa Restoration 2013 on Flickr.",
