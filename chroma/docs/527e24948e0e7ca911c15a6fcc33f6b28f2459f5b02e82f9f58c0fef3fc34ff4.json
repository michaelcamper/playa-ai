  "content": "With a theme like Radical Ritual, it’s no wonder Burning Man 2017 will be home to 30 different Shrines.\n\nAt the center of Black Rock City, 20 Shrines will inscribe a circle around the Man base, known this year as the Temple of the Golden Spike. Throughout the week, the space will be energized with processions and rituals, inviting the denizens of BRC to explore what we as a community consider sacrosanct.\n\nFrom traditional spirit houses offering protection to playful rituals; from shrines celebrating nature, water, and geographic regions to the exploration of dualities: mortal/divine, virgin/bitch, death/rebirth; from places of quiet reflection to those of simple action; from the importance of touch to the power within our own hands, all Shrines invite participants to engage with the sacred and leave offerings: written, thought, spoken, sung or secret. In the spirit of the sentiment, We don’t burn something to destroy it, we burn it to protect it, when the Man burns on Saturday night, these Shrines and the offerings made unto them will burn with it.\n\nIn addition to the 20 Shrines at the Man Pavilion, there will be 10 Shrines in the city Plazas, five in the 4:30 plaza and five at 7:30. The vision is to create small Art Parks within these plazas that work to slow traffic, encourage exploration, and engender interaction as a pathway to discovery. Here you will find an assortment of show-stoppers such as the bronze casting of a shy but helpful animal deity, the makings of a Bacchanalian disco, the physical tracings of our emotional journeys, and an interactive altar to psychedelic Buddhism.\n\nThe 2017 Shrines are part of the evolution of projects at the Man Pavillion: C.O.R.E., Souk, Midway, Guilds, and now Shrines. What began as an invitation to the Burning Man Regionals to contribute community projects has grown to incorporate artists and makers of all kinds: Regionals, community groups, individual artists and collectives. What’s more, the art at the Man Pavilion has taken on the role of encouraging new artists, introducing them to the Burning Man granting process, and providing smaller-scale opportunities to get acquainted with what it takes to bring a project to fruition in the often unrelenting and unpredictable conditions on playa. Five of the 2017 Honoraria Grants were made to groups that got their start in the Man Pavilion program!\n\nWater protector? Transcendentalist? Looking for your best near future self? In search of a quiet place of reflection? Seeking ancestors? A keeper for your secrets? The help of a Huldre? Somewhere in the dust is a Shrine for every seeker.\n\nMan Pavillion Shrines\n\nAbuelo Fuego — Philip DePoala & Intrepid Arts — Saugerties, NY\n\nAhimsa Hamsa — Cat Dunleavy, Joe Taylor & Cafe Diem — Kings Beach, CA\n\nAltar de Carroñero/Scavenger Altar — Deadneck West / Carina Botanik — Reno, NV\n\nAyni Despacho: Planting the Seeds of of Man’s Becoming — Lorraine Esther & the ‘eL Womyn — Gardnerville-Sierra, NV\n\nBuddha Bank — Denver Burners — Denver, CO\n\nGauchito Gil and the Pagan Gang — Tati Perkins & Gauchos del Fuego — Mexico City, Mexico & Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nHouse of the Golden Raven — Eva Reiska with the Estonian Burners — Tallinn, Estonia\n\nMorning Ritual — Camp Furry Gorilla Warfare — Irvine, CA\n\nNorthern Spork — Kellie Larson & Tom Mays  with MN Regional Burning Arts Cooperative — Minneapolis, MN\n\nPagan Bunny Shrine — Sunshine Rae Kelly & Pagan Bunny Builders — Elk Creek, CA\n\nSacrarium of Serendipity — Singe & Nubbin — Minneapolis, MN\n\nShrine de Vine — Elizabeth Marley + the Growing Architecture Collective — San Francisco, CA\n\nShrine of Brotherly Love — Philly Burners — Philadelphia, PA\n\nShrine of Dough — Andrew Sczesnak & Chris Swimmer — Berkeley, CA\n\nSilent Lotus — Kyle Larrain — Truckee, CA\n\nThe Aquarian Shrine — Jade Fusco, The DMZL — Austin, TX\n\nThe Gilded Brine Shrimp — Vaughn Perkins — Elk Creek, CA\n\nThe Shrine of Lost Moments — German & Berlin Burners — Germany\n\nThe Temple of the Inner Bitch — Anna Metcalf & the Bitch Collective — New Orleans, LA\n\nWings of Eos — Roxane Bounce Williams — Redwood City, CA\n\nPlaza Shrines\n\nAS-IF Shrine — Francesca Gaskin and Panda Camp — London, Great Britain\n\nASURA Bike — ASURA Bike Team — Japan\n\nBarry the Disco Goat — Christina Solis — Houston, TX\n\nEmotional Journeys — Alexander “Wolf” Griffin — Portland, OR\n\nInternal Flame — Kyle Stryker — Occidental, CA\n\nLeave No Spirit — Bend and Central Oregon Network (BACON) of Burners — Oregon\n\nMy Daily, and Lifelong, Hiawatha #1 — Jimmy Descant & Amalgamated Debris Assemblage — Salida, CO\n\nMystic Huldre — Steffin Griswold & MN Regional Burning Arts Cooperative — Minneapolis, MN\n\nShrine of the Singing Sun — Servants of the Secret Fire — San Francisco, CA\n\nThe Messenger Shrine — Gabriel Allan and The Emissaries of the Burning Heart — Charlottesville, VA\n\nSpecial call out to our DPW folks\n\nAltar de Carroñero/Scavenger Altar — Deadneck West / Carina Botanik — Reno, NV\n\nHouse of the Golden Raven — Eva Reiska with the Estonian Burners — Tallinn, Estonia\n\nInternal Flame — Kyle Stryker — Occidental, CA\n\nSilent Lotus — Kyle Larrain — Truckee, CA\n\nHonoraria projects with roots in the Man Pavilion program\n\nBlacksmith Shop — Anton Standteiner & Blacksmith Shop — Truckee, CA\n\nDance For The Dawn — Karolis Misevicius & Lithuania Burners — Vilnius, Lithuania\n\nHispatext — Mariano Rodriguez Ribas & Gauchos del Fuego — Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nThe Dragonfly Mating Ritual — Ed VanDyne & Rocky Mountain High Flyers Guild — Loveland, CO\n\nThe Temple of Awareness — Bobby Gittins & Utah Builders Community (UBC) — Salt Lake City, UT\n\nTop image: Altar de Carroñero/Scavenger Altar — Deadneck West / Carina Botanik — Reno, NV",
