With another year of digital co-creation under their sparkly belts, independent teams of Burners and digital creators from across the known Burner-verse are hard at work building Virtual Burning Man 2021, which will in full swing from August 22 through September 7, 2021.\n\nWherever you are and however you long to participate, you’ll be able to dive into six of the awe-inspiring Worlds from last year’s 2020 Burning Man Multiverse — all bigger, bolder, wilder, and weirder for 2021.\n\nTickets for this year’s Virtual Burn experiences are officially available. Visit this ticketing page* to secure your spot in any one (or more!) of the six amazing Virtual Burn Worlds, playing host to one and all — from experienced Burners to those who are exploring Burning Man culture for the first time.\n\nEach World is offering unique, radically inclusive opportunities to engage as a participant and creator in the wildly expressive global Burning Man community. Anybody with an internet connection — anywhere! — is invited to explore eye-popping 3D art, meet virtual Burners from around the world, participate in community workshops, dance all night, and endlessly explore multiple virtual playas during Virtual Burn Week — whether you’re dropping in with a VR headset, a desktop computer or a mobile device.\n\nThe 165,000 virtual Burners who participated in these whimsical, interactive, and awe-inspiring experiences in 2020 discovered Burning Man is more than a physical place — it’s an opportunity to engage deeply with others through authentic connections around a shared passion for Radical Self-expression, wherever you live.\n\nDiscover what’s in store, learn how you can participate, get your tickets, and gear up to join us in the digital dust for Virtual Burn Week 2021!\n\nWhat’s In Store?

Learn how to bring your art installation, mutant vehicle, theme camp, performance, workshop, yoga class, or [your awesome idea here] into the virtual realm!
