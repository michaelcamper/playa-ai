  "content": "The Participation and Civic Responsibility Principles mean that we operate in a Do-ocracy. If you don’t like how something is being done, volunteer to make it better.\n\nSo it irked me when I saw a bunch of online complaining about the new location of San Diego’s Regional Burn, YOUtopia.  “Oh, really? Did you do some location scouting and negotiating with property owners that was ignored by organizers? Or did you just decide that you don’t like the change and so criticize the decisions made by the people who were willing to do the work?”\n\nLook, I am ALL about being critical and making improvements. Burning Man is an iterative city and gives us the luxury of annual lessons and upgrades. But criticism without an offer to help is pretty empty. Not worthless, but it definitely holds less weight than the opinions of someone who says, “I can see how this could be better, and I’ll take the lead to make it so.”\n\nThis is true on micro and macro levels: Within Theme Camps, Black Rock City, the United States, and the world.\n\nLife is a Do-acracy. Speak up and step up.\n\nBelow is the video where I got riled up about this. And the transcript is here for those of you who find my face and voice annoying AF. (Or are hearing impaired.)\n\nAnd guess what? Apparently “do-acracy” is something that often comes up during Decompression. Here is a rant I went on LAST year when people complained about art.\n\nTop photo by Halcyon",
