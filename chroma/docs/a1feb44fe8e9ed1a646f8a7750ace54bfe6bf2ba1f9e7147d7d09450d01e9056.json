  "content": "Black Rock Station, Nevada – June 27th, 2009\n\nYesterday, the DPW workshop stood empty, a nondescript metal quonset amidst the low, gravelly scrub that rings the Black Rock desert. Today the workshop is full.\n\nFull of people. Full of movement. Full of sawdust.\n\nFull of activity and creativity and – to keep things balanced – a little destruction.\n\nFull of music from a dusty stereo, doggedly fighting its hopeless battle with The Carpenter’s Orchestra: the bass drone of belt sander and shop vac, the baritone buzz of table and chop saws, the three tenors, jigsaw, Sawzall and drill, and the 30,000 rpm soprano herself, the trim router, ever the diva.\n\nFull of intention, the magickal force necessary to resurrect an icon from the ashes, so that it may once again take its place at the center of Black Rock City, our dear dusty Brigadoon.\n\nFull of the elaborate dance of lore, luck and skill that gives birth to the Burning Man.\n\nMan Build 2009 has begun.",
