  "content": "Once again, the outreach groups of Burning Man ([BWB], The Black Rock Arts Foundation, [BRS] and The Regional Network) have teamed up to create a unified presence on the playa: District Everywhere!\n\nDistrict Everywhere is housed under one large pavilion. This year, our interior space will take on the appearance of a large world map, with continents cut out of wood, set up at table height. With the assistance of our Team, guests will create miniature sculptures or flags to represent their off-playa projects and endeavors. Together, the outreach groups will also host interactive activities, art projects, events and gatherings, all geared toward kindling ideas and generating momentum for off-playa, after-Burning Man out reach efforts. Join us for daily BurnSide Chats, hosted lectures, salons and discussions about art, community and culture. Each outreach group will also be hosting cocktail parties and mixers specifically for their group at District Everywhere.  Please visit the Black Rock Arts Foundation any day of the week to learn more about recent projects and future endeavors, and to add to their community-created art installation.  They will be lounging in the shade, sipping lemonade and conspiring to bring interactive art to communities beyond the playa.\n\nBRAF at Burning Man\nMonday, August 30, 2010 – Sunday, September 6, 2010\n6:30 and Esplanade\nBlack Rock City, NV\n10:00 am – 6:00 pm\n\nBurnside Chats\nMonday, August 30, 2010 – Saturday, September 4, 2010\n1:00 pm – 2:30 pm and 2:30 pm – 4:00 pm\n\nParty Everywhere – opening reception for District Everywhere\nMonday, August 30, 2010   5:00 pm – 7:00 pm\n\nAnnual BRAF Playa Cocktail Party\nThursday, September 2, 2010     4:00 pm – 6:00 pm\nDistrict Everywhere is located at 6:30 and Esplanade.\n\nWe’d love to see you!\n\nphoto: affinity",
