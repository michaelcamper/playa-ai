  "content": "Here’s a sweet story for you.\n\nAt Burning Man this year, first-time Burner Paul Duane decided to pose this question to Burners he encountered:\n\n“Imagine that I handed you a microphone; when you speak into it, the whole world can understand and hear you at the same time.  You can make 3 statements. What would you say?”\n\nPeople wrote down their answers, and he took their pictures. Here’s what happened.\n\nOK so wait. That’s not the cool part. The cool part is that an elementary school teacher in North Carolina saw his “3 Things” photo essay, and decided to have her students do it too. And she posted their photos.\n\nPaul said, “I was excited to see my Burning Man experience make it clear into the classroom of some kids on the other side of the country …”\n\nWe’d most definitely have to agree.",
