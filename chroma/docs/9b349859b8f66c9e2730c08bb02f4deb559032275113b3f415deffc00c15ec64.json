  "content": "Many years ago on a night of playa wandering I came upon an amazing work of art. I didn’t even know the name of it. I sat utterly mesmerized by it and returned throughout the week to participate. Later I would find out it was Sisyphish, also affectionately known as The Swimmers, by Peter Hudson. It was the beginning of my unabashed love of Peter’s zoetropic genius.\n\nHe has has graced the playa with many creations following Sisyphish, in 2004 with Deeper (aka the divers), 2007’s playful Homouroboros (aka The Monkeys) and 2008’s Tantalus. Returning this year after a two-year hiatus he is brings us Charon. Based in Greek mythology, Charon is the gondolier to the afterlife. This interactive artwork will physically engage people in “a vigorous genuflection of sorts.”\n\nPeter Says of his latest work:\n\nThe best part of this year’s project is that WE can all help make it happen by supporting Peter’s Kickstarter campaign.\n\nAs we saw last year, Kickstarter is an essential tool that many artists use to complete their visions of participatory art.",
