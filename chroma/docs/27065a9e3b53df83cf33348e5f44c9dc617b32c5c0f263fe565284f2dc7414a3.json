  "content": "I loved the theme from the start. It turned up the volume on all that is deep and sacred about Burning Man.\nIt took me years before I had the courage to say that Burning Man was my “Religion.”\nBut this is it. I’ve followed it’s traditions. I’ve created my own.\nI’ve found a calling and a congregation. And a temple.\nThis video is about my experience with the Temple this year.\nI am so grateful to everyone who designed, built, protected, & contributed to that magical space. Thank God it exists. Well, *did* exist. Does exist.\n\nEveryone’s Temple experience is unique. I know your’s was perfect, too.",
