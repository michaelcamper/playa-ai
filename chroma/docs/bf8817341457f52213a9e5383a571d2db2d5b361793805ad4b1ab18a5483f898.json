  "content": "To misquote a great film noir: “There are 80,000 stories in the dusty city.” And that’s just the beginning. Beyond Black Rock City, around the world the Burning Man community is endlessly industrious and curious, creative and irreverent. How can we ever begin to document it all?\n\nWe can’t. But as the Burnerverse iterates through its annual cycle, we gather your stories, participate in your triumphs and struggles, and join in the Immediacy of shared experiences.\n\nThen we read the tea leaves, distill the moment we’re in, and create the Dispatch — our yearly folio of voices from the year that was.\n\nAs a global organism, Burning Man culture flourishes because of YOU…. and also thanks to our eclectic roots. In addition to encapsulating Waking Dreams’ abundance of wonders, the 2022 Dispatch maps just some of the collectives that built Burning Man’s early source code.\n\nAs we collectively prepare to join the participatory parade of whimsical fauna that will be BRC 2023, let’s pause just a moment, breathe, and contemplate the relationships and stories, ephemeral patterns and world-changing shifts that Burners are so good at bringing into this world.",
