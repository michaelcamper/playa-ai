  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is still back with a third season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for experiences from the participants, the triumphs from volunteers, and adorable weirdos of all stripes!\n\nS03 E05 – This is Xeno\n\nFriend-of-the-Show Xeno exerts his friendship on the show something fierce. Learn the sordid history of Xeno, while he, Rex and DJ Beth get a little unconscionable at Accuracy Third’s second visit to The Vulcan.\n\nS03 E06 – Buckets of Playa Filled With Blood\n\nThe second episode from DJ Beth and Rex’s infiltration of the belly of the DPW beast. The epilogue and afterword for Frisky Whisky’s playa plane crash (from S02 E07). Gage’s first season. Friend-of-the-Show Xeno is giving Mohawks. Pound Town figures out the timing. Rob is never going back. The Peppermill is a thing. Ice skating on playa. The Gerlach barbecue. Lucky’s on Avenue B in NYC. Weird in the wrong way. Plus, everyone shouts “no” at Beth, and variable intoxication throughout.\n\nAccuracy Third LIVE on May 5 in San Francisco!\n\nAccuracy Third is doing the thing that Accuracy Third does, but LIVE! You’ve heard them with your ears, now hear them with your faces!\n\nWhat do they have to offer you in terms of excitement?\n\nMay 5, 2018\n8:00 – 11:00 pm\n$10 @ the door or online.\n\nLittle Boxes Theater\n1661 Tennessee Street, Suite 2S\nSan Francisco\n\nThe Accuracy Third Podcast is given as a gift to the community and funded exclusively by gifts from the community.
