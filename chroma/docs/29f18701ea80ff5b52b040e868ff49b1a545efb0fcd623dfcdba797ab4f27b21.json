  "content": "The Dallas Observer reports on a local man who went to Burning Man, had an epiphany (as you do), and took it back home with him in a very real way.\n\nInfluenced by his years of attending the Burning Man event, Dallas pizza shop owner Frank Nuccio decided to make some changes to his business’s (My Family’s Pizza, formerly Pizza by Marco) pizza-making process.\n\n“The dough will use water only from a reverse osmosis system being installed this month. I’m removing all toxins such as chlorine and fluoride from all the water used in the restaurant,” Frank said. Not only that, he’s also stopped selling any products that contain aspartame — including soda — instead opting for a soda brand made with pure cane sugar (which tastes a helluva lot better, frankly).\n\nWe like to say that being a Burner is a way of being, a lens through which we perceive our relationship to the world, and it’s up to each of us to make change happen on a local as well as global level … as we do. And a pizza joint is as good a place to start as any, right? Right.\n\nNice job, Frank. Next time we’re in Dallas, we’ll be sure to stop in for a slice.\n\nSo tell us, how have YOU manifested your Burner ideals in your day-to-day life?",
