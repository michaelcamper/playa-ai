  "content": "This summer, IDEATE and Black Rock Labs created a program to buy carbon offsets for your 2017 Burn, which we called out here in the Journal. C-Quest, the offset provider, has a nice update on the impact of that project:\n\nMy, that sounds like a lot of pounds! According to C-Quest’s estimates, which you can find on their website, 1,228,600 lbs. of CO2 emission reduction equals 877 BRC participants’ emissions during the whole event, or 1.4% of BRC’s total emissions. From the perspective of reducing BRC’s carbon footprint, this program made a small but significant start.\n\nThat’s not the only way to look at the impact, though. On the other end of this exchange, Burning Man participants installed 55 new clean-tech cookstoves in rural Zambia. In addition to the carbon emission reductions, these stoves have an enormous effect of the respiratory health of the people using them every day, so that’s a great thing, too. Here’s more from C-Quest’s report:\n\nHere’s a video of the people who benefitted from this Burner-funded program:\n\nSo while buying carbon offsets is just one of a gazillion ways you can reduce the environmental impact of your Burn, this program has the bonus effect of making some people’s lives way better!\n\nStay tuned for updates about how to participate in 2018.\n\nTop photo courtesy of C-Quest",
