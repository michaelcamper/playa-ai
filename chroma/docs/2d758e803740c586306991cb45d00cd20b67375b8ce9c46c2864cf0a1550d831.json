  "content": "Burners Without Borders (BWB) is starting a new video series called “Community Conversations,” which are online conversations about how to create communities and projects focused on civic engagement and social impact.\n\nWe’ve launched our first video, and we’re honored to highlight BWB-Vancouver and their five-year project “Christmas isn’t Over.” This video features community leader and former Regional Contact Kristy Abel, who talks about activating community and maintaining volunteers, and shares tips and tricks on how you can do it yourself at home.\n\nIf your local community has a project they’d like featured in a Community Conversation, reach out and let us know at bwb@burningman.org. We’re starting to put together our schedule for 2019 and beyond. It doesn’t need to be a BWB project, but it needs to focus on civic engagement.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Kristy Abel, Mia Wallace, Molly Rose and all of BWB Vancouver for helping to put this pilot video together.\n\n(Top photo by Vert Umnus)",
