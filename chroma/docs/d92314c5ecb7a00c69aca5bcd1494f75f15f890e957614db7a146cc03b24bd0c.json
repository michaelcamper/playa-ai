Here’s the scoop from Ellen Kunz, Environmental Health Specialist with the Nevada State Health Divisions Public Health and Clinical Services Environmental Health Program:\n\n“In order to fight the threat of food-borne illness on the playa, the Nevada State Health Division (NSHD) has requirements for camps preparing food including the need of a health permit and an inspection. You must apply for and be permitted as a Temporary Food Establishment by the NSHD if:\n\nYou will be cooking or serving food to large groups of more than 125 FELLOW CAMPERS of your camp on a consistent basis. (If you have a communal kitchen shared by 125 or more campers, but meals are prepared individually, or in smaller quantities than for 125 persons, a permit is not required, however we highly recommend you research and review safe food handling practices, starting with the Nevada State Division of Health information.)\nYou wish to share, cook or serve food or non-alcoholic beverages to the general Burning Man population (gifting food).\nHere are the permit procedures and deadlines:\n\nComplete the ‘Food Permit Application for Burning Man’ found here. (Look for the flame icon at the bottom of the page for the application and other food safety information and guidelines regarding Burning Man.)\n\nIf you have already applied for a permit, you should be receiving instructions in the mail soon.\n\nDEADLINES:\n\nVia Mail: We must have sufficient time to be able to process the application and send back a letter of confirmation. So they need to be received at Ellen Kunz’s office in Winnemucca no later than one week before the event – August 15, 2014.\n\nDon’t wait until the last minute. It would be a shame to have to cancel your plans, or even risk being closed at the event. The mailing address is  NSHD – PHCS 475 West Haskell Street Suite 38, Winnemucca, NV 89445.\n\nIn Person: No later than THURSDAY AUGUST 22. 4150 Technology Way Suite 100, Carson City, NV. Phone: (775) 687-7550 or 475 West Haskell Street Suite 38 Winnemucca, NV.  Phone (775) 623-6588.\n\nOn the application, the event coordinator is ‘Burning Man’. Leave the location blank, unless you know what street and intersection you’ll be at during the event. After mailing the application and $50 USD payment, you must come and pick up your permit at Playa Info in Center Camp from Sunday August 24 through Saturday August 30 (specific hours to be determined and announced).\n\nWe do this so that we can get an accurate camp location to do inspections. We are NOT issuing new permits at Playa Info.\n\nIMPORTANT: A number of camps last year did not complete the permit process by picking up their permit at Playa Info and receiving their inspection. Not completing the process is the same as not being permitted. Don’t be shut down. You must pick up your permit and be inspected to be in compliance.\n\nADDITIONAL QUESTIONS: Please contact Ellen Kunz (775) 623-6588 or email her at ekunz@health.nv.gov.”",
