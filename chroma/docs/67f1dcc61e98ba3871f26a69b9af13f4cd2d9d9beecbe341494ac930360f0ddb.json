  "content": "There’s something about Polaroid pictures that says “vacation” to me. And Burning Man is a lot of things, and I guess vacation is one of them. So here’s a little collection of Polaroids to whet your appetite for the trip, and for the desert, and for the drive across Indian land, and for that feeling of excitement you’ll get in the pit of your stomach when you get off Route 80 in Wadsworth and head for the dust and the heat and the fun.\n\nBe careful, though, especially if you haven’t been out this way before. There are a number of places that have reduced speed limits. You’ll really want to slow down to a crawl, unless you want to make a pricey contribution to the local traffic department budget.",
