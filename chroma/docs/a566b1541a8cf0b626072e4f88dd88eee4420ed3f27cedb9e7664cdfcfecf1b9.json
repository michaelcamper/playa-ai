  "content": "The Black Rock City (BRC) Census is a volunteer-led collaborative research project that collects demographic data on, and aims to develop a deeper understanding of, the diverse community that inhabits Black Rock City. This is done annually through a random sample on the playa and an online survey after the event. The process allows statistically robust estimates of the population characteristics and analyzes trends in Black Rock City population over time by comparing data across years to provide insights into how the demographics are shifting. Census is passionate about sharing findings with the Burning Man community and general public through detailed annual reports.\n\n“2023 was a funky year that only brought Burners closer together and strengthened us as a community. As we get ready to head back into the dust in 2024, let’s look back at the wealth of valuable data provided by citizens of Black Rock City in their responses to the 2023 online Census survey, to help us gain a better understanding of who was there and how their experience at Burning Man impacted them both on and off playa.” — Maher Abdel-Sattar (aka Random), BRC Census Assistant Manager\n\nThe 2023 Census effort involved over 160 volunteers who completed 543 shifts to collect data from randomly selected participants at entry points including the main gate, airport, and Burner Express Buses. This massive volunteer effort enables statistically robust population estimates for BRC each year. Thank you to every single one of our amazing volunteers for helping us make this happen, including our lead statistician Aaron Shev (Murrs)! We also want to thank the 7,712 Burners who completed the Census online survey and gifted us their data in 2023.\n\n2023 Census data report\n\nWe previously published some preliminary 2023 statistics highlighting select demographic information that was collected through our random sample on playa. Now, we are very excited to share the comprehensive and more accurate 2023 adjusted final statistics from our online survey, as summarized in our latest data report. Below are some highlights from the 2023 BRC Census Annual Report you may find interesting. Feel free to explore the entire report for additional details and other awesome findings.\n\nDemographics: Who was at Black Rock City in 2023?\n\nThe Census data report provides a comprehensive demographic breakdown of BRC’s population. It reveals interesting insights into the age distribution, gender representation, educational background, average income, and geographic origins of BRC citizens. This diversity fosters a rich and inclusive cultural experience that transcends most societal boundaries. There were approximately 77,000 Burners on playa in total in 2023, including 7,712 Burners (about 10%) who completed the Census online survey after the Burn.\n\nMedian age: 36 years old\n\nThe median age of BRC citizens has been steadily hovering around 35 years of age since we began our trend analysis in 2013. The median age of a BRC citizen in 2023 was 36 years old, compared to a high of 37 years old in 2022 and a low of 33 years old back in 2015.\n\nCurrent gender: Record percentage of female Burners\n\nFor the first time ever, Census data indicate that there was an almost equal proportion of males and females on playa in 2023. Interestingly, our adjusted data suggest that females (49.1%) may have even surpassed the percentage of males (47.9%) on playa in 2023, with the remaining 3% selecting other or no gender identity labels. This is a notable change from previous years where we saw anywhere from 10% to 19% more BRC citizens identifying as male versus female.\n\nEthnoracial identity: Increased Latino and Asian representation\n\nThe number of Burners reporting their ethnoracial background as White (non-hispanic) decreased from 80.5% in 2022 to 78.2% in 2023. The next largest ethnoracial group was Hispanic/Latino, increasing from 9.7% in 2022 to 10.5% in 2023. This was followed by the Asian ethnoracial group, increasing from 7.9% in 2022 to 9.4% in 2023. The remaining groups stayed relatively the same from 2022, with 3.0% Middle Eastern or North African, 2.1% Black (non-Hispanic), 1.2% Native American, and 3.4% other backgrounds in 2023.\n\nWhere are Burners from?\n\nAbout 40% of Burners traveling to BRC are residents of California (36.0%) and Nevada (4.0%). Other states in the U.S. make up 39.8% of the population, with high representation from New York, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington state. Canadians make up 5.6% of the population, and the remaining 14.5% travel to BRC from other countries outside of the U.S. and Canada.\n\nFirst-timers at BRC: Record high of 43.9% first-year participants (sometimes affectionately referred to as “virgins”)\n\nThe proportion of first-year participants reached an all-time high in 2023, where first-time BRC citizens accounted for 43.9% of the total population. This is a significant jump from 28.3% first-year participants in 2022.\n\nLearning and Practicing New Skills\n\nBlack Rock City citizens get to learn and practice a number of new skills during their time on playa ranging from new hobbies to interpersonal skills. Often, Burners are inspired to continue exploring and refining those skills outside of BRC, and that can have a positive impact on their daily lives.\n\nFinding inspiration\n\nCrafting and art creation was the skill that over half (59.4%) of BRC citizens were inspired to continue learning and developing off playa. Emotional intelligence and self-awareness (48.7%) was a close second, followed by self-care strategies (39.2%) and survival skills (38.4%).\n\nApplication of new skills\n\nIn 2023, 60.2% of BRC citizens utilized their newly learned skills to create things for themselves or their family off playa and 36.8% leveraged those skills to create things at home that they plan to bring to BRC in the future. Also, 32.9% applied those skills to create things for their home communities and 23.3% taught those skills to others in their respective communities.\n\nImpact of new skills\n\nAs a result of the joy and/or growth achieved from continuing to learn and practice new skills acquired on playa, 69.9% of BRC citizens felt more fulfilled as individuals in their daily lives. Furthermore, practicing those skills led 36.4% of BRC citizens to develop new and fulfilling relationships in their home communities.\n\nEmbracing the 10 Principles\n\nThe 10 Principles sit at the core of Burning Man culture. The data report sheds light on how participants embrace and embody Radical Inclusion, Radical Self-reliance, Communal Effort, Gifting, and more during the event. It showcases the incredible spirit of collaboration, artistry, and interactivity that pervades Black Rock City.\n\nImportance of the 10 Principles on playa\n\nBRC citizens report annually that the 10 Principles are essential to creating an authentic Burning Man experience. In 2023, 93.5% agreed that the 10 Principles continue to be essential (24.1%) or very essential (69.4%).\n\nApplying the 10 Principles in everyday life\n\nEven in the default world, Burners continue to embrace the 10 Principles in everyday life. Radical self-reliance (54.2%), leave no trace (40.6%), and radical inclusion (38.8%) were the top 3 Principles that Burners reported practicing most commonly outside of BRC in 2023.\n\nSpirit of volunteerism\n\nThe Burning Man experience inspires many to volunteer beyond their time at BRC. On average, about half of participants (52.6% in 2023) reported being inspired to volunteer, donate, or get involved in other ways after leaving BRC.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability: Leave No Trace!\n\nAn essential aspect of the Burning Man ethos is the commitment to leaving no trace. In 2019, Burning Man Project made a commitment to be carbon negative by 2030, as described in the Environmental Sustainability Roadmap. To meet this ambitious goal, significant shifts have been made to work towards greater sustainability — both by the nonprofit and by the Burning Man community.\n\nImportance of environmental sustainability efforts by Burning Man Project\n\nThe majority of BRC citizens (88.1%) reported sustainability efforts by Burning Man Project to be essential (62.0%) or very important (26.1%) in 2023.\n\nNoticeable 2023 environmental sustainability efforts in BRC\n\nBRC citizens noticed camps increasing their adoption of solar power and battery technologies (42.4%), in addition to other efforts to reduce their environmental impact (24.7%) in 2023. About a quarter of Burners (25.7%) also appreciated that the Man was solar-powered in 2023.\n\nRadical Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (R.I.D.E.)\n\nAnother important initiative of Burning Man Project is Radical Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (R.I.D.E.). The cross-departmental Stewardship Group prioritizes, manages, and advocates for R.I.D.E. work across Burning Man Project staff, BRC, and Burner communities beyond the playa.\n\nR.I.D.E. in action at BRC\n\nIn 2023, 38.0% of BRC citizens reported noticing more diversity among Burners on playa, 20.4% saw art projects related to diversity and radical inclusion, and 28.4% applauded theme camps for being welcoming and celebrating minorities and under-represented communities.\n\nPersonal contributions to creating a more diverse and welcoming BRC\n\nIn 2023, 26.8% of BRC citizens were part of camps or art projects that welcomed new members from under-represented communities. Also, 25.4% reported visiting the expanded gayborhoods in the 4:30 and 7:30 sectors. Off playa, 45.9% of Burners stated that they actively support diversity and inclusion in their home communities.\n\nCome to Your Census!\n\nWe hope you enjoyed learning more about BRC’s evolving population based on data collected by the Black Rock City Census in 2023.
