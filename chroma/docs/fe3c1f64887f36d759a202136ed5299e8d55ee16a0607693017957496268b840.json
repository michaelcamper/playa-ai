  "content": "It’s not as well known as that one art car that shoots all the fire, or that sculpture that does the thing when you touch it with the lights – but for years the Pinhole Camera group at Burning Man has been producing some of the playa’s finest back-and-white photography, and they’ve developed a following.\n\nFor years the group has been based out of Media Mecca, using one of Mecca’s shipping containers as an on-playa dark room.  Putting on gloves, sploshing chemicals – I’m pretty sure some people have gotten it on in there, too, but sadly it wasn’t me.\n\nThis year, just in time for Caravansary, the Pinhole Camera group is hitting the road, with an all new home!  Look for the “Desert Darkroom” in Illumination Village – at 2:30 and Esplanade.\n\nDon’t want to go that far?  Look for their work to be displayed in the Center Camp Café as well.\n\nAnd if you want to make some art yourself?  Oh, they’re ALWAYS willing to train new people.  It’s a surprisingly simple process, and you’ll be helping make great art in no time!\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.pinholeproject.org/",
