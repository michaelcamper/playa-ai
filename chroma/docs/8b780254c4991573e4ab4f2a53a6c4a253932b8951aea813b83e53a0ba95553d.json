  "content": "In the digital age of the short-lived meme, the sticker’s value reigns supreme.\n\nThe inherent prospect of permanence earns a level of attention we modern beings sometimes forget we possess as we scroll through life.\n\nYet this permanence doesn’t make it an artform of the elite, and therein lies the beauty. Anyone can make a sticker, and sometimes our favorite stickers are the least assuming, even janky, if you will. That doesn’t mean we don’t drool over immaculate design (oh, we do), but who can deny the delight derived from a design that makes us ponder, “WTF?” and, “Was this made with MS Paint?”\n\nAll this is to say — sticker season is upon us, and we want to see your designs! And with a theme like Metamorphoses, there’s no telling what ideas you’ll be inspired to transform into adhesive art. Apart from butterflies. Obviously there will be butterflies.\n\nEvery year we choose 10-15 designs and print hundreds of thousands of stickers to give away freely on the playa, including one as the officially-unofficial “Greeter Sticker” each Burner receives as they enter our dusty city.\n\nSo if you’re interested in seeing your sticker design materialize in the desert, here’s what to do:\n\nDesign Specs\n\nYour design(s) will need to be one of three die sizes:\n\nIf using 1–3 colors, set up the file to print as PMS. If using 4 or more colors, set up the file to print as CMYK.\n\nDesigner Tips ‘n’ Tricks\n\nSubmitting Your Art\n\nDeadline\n\nMonday, May 13. No art can be accepted after this date!",
