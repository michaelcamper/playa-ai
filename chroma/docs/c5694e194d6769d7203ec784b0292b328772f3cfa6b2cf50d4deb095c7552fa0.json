Burning Man Regional Groups in more than 120 regions spanning over 20 countries are developing ways to engage local communities around the creative spirit, year-round.\n\nEarlier this month, Firefly Arts Collective  — who organize the official New England Burning Man regional event Firefly — took part in Somerville Open Studios, one of the largest weekend-long open studio events in the United States.\n\nHome to many Firefly artists and a growing arts community, Somerville is located just north of Boston.\n\nAfter large manufacturing industries started departing the city in the 1960s, artists activated the abandoned industrial buildings, transforming them into studios and workshops.\n\nFirefly’s members are an eclectic group … in their words:\n\n2013 marks the second year this collective brightened Somerville Open Studios. 21 Firefly members exhibited and discussed their creations, attracting families and art-curious crowds from the Boston area to their space\n\nVisiting surrounding studios also gave members “a much needed change of perspective that made it possible to come back with new eyes and enjoy the fruits of our labor,” as one Firefly Open Studio Team member remarked.\n\nTheir regional event Firefly takes place on July 3-7 in the woods of New England. To get a peek of what to expect, take a look at the photos below. More art awaits in their photo gallery.\n\nWant to get involved where you live? Locate your local community here.",
