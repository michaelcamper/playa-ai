  "content": "It’s that glorious time of year again, when spring is in the air and sticker designs are bouncing around in Burners’ brains like wild fairy shrimp… Do you have a burning playa phrase or an image that you’ve been desperately wishing was a sticker — to proudly display in the dust or gift to others? Then simply read the requirements (below) and send your sticker design(s) our way! Whether your final designs are digital or handdrawn, they’re all equally welcome.\n\nYou love to collect them, we love to print them. That’s why, each year, we proudly invite YOU to become an integral part of this time-honored tradition, helping us prepare for our annual trek to the desert. It’s just one example of our radically participatory culture in action: the citizens of Black Rock City get to design stickers for what will become our Gate (welcome) sticker — handed out by Greeters at the entrance of the city, accompanied by the WhatWhereWhen booklet — along with a handful of other selected sticker designs which we print for Gifting throughout the week.\n\nPlease carefully read (then re-read) each of the submission requirements listed below, in order for your 2025 Burning Man sticker design(s) to be considered. Most importantly, get ready to unleash your imagination — we can’t wait to see what you come up with!\n\nYOUR 2025 STICKER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\n\nGood luck, and may your designs take your imagination to the uncharted territories of Tomorrow Today. Selected sticker designs will be contacted via email.",
