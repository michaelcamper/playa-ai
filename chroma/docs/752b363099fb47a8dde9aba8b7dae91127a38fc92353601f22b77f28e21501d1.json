  "content": "It’s less than 100 days until the Man burns (!!) — are you starting to think about Burning Man yet? No matter where you are in your planning, you won’t want to miss this exciting opportunity to preview some of the stunning art projects coming to Black Rock City in 2018.\n\nThe Desert Arts Preview is quickly approaching, and we’d like to invite you to be a part of this magical and beloved annual event. Featured artists will share their inspiration and hopes for their works-in-progress, giving you an exclusive window into their imagination and creative process.\n\nWe will celebrate 30 art projects through short presentations and the art gallery, which will feature images and information on each project: from a 32’-tall polar bear made out of recycled car hoods, to a great train wreck, to a burning bird cage, to an impossible stone arch, and — one of my favorites — a giant joke-telling banana peel (only at Burning Man).\n\nYou’ll learn about the rainbow bridge from the creators of last year’s giant flamingo, and the Fergusons’ gleaming eagle — an evolution of their penny-covered sculptures, now with nickels and dimes!\n\nMeet the artists of the cactus garden that has bloomed in the wrong desert, and the oversized fire-flash Victorian-era camera. Get ready to explore an exciting range of robots, trees, giant flowers, UFOs and a wide collection of the amazing and interactive art that delights us every year in Black Rock City.\n\nAnd we’re thrilled that Arthur Mamou-Mani, the lead artist of Galaxia, this year’s Temple, will be there in person from the U.K. to share insights and progress from his international team of temple builders.\n\nThis year the Desert Arts Preview program will include a tribute to Larry Harvey. As our community continues to honor the passing of our founder, friend and original instigator, we invite you to celebrate his creative legacy and artistic vision by leaving a personal note at the special installation in the theater lobby. Profiles in the Dust has also created a video tribute that we will share with you.\n\nIt also wouldn’t be a Burning Man event without a chance to get involved. All 30 projects will include a “call to action” and ways for you to engage with the project — everything from volunteering on a build crew to offering technical or legal advice. It’s the perfect opportunity to learn how you can participate and support these artists.\n\nIf you’re the type who prefers to be surprised when you see the art in Black Rock City, never fear — we’re featuring 30 out of 300+ projects, so there will still be many wonders in store. And if you have an artistic vision that you’d like to share, you are warmly invited to make it happen.\n\nDesert Arts Preview is on Sunday, 3 June at the historic Nourse Theater in San Francisco. There’s much to see, hear, sip and nibble, so make sure you arrive on time. Doors open at 6:00pm, and light fare and festive mocktails will be available as part of your admission. Fifteen speakers will then start giving their short presentations at 7:00 pm sharp. Tickets are available here and at the door.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you there for this celebration of creativity!\n\nPresenting Artists\n\nGalaxia, The Temple — Arthur Mamou-Mani\n\nCamera Lucida — Bill Evans\n\nChilopod — Lawrence Grown and TeamEmbrio\n\nKinesios — Bradley Norris and ND Collective\n\nLong View: A Polar Bear Stands in the Desert — Don Kennell and Arctic Burn 505\n\nLuna Flora — Elana Novali, Timjim Bear and The Coop at Arcosanti\n\nMyriapoda Robota — David Date and Art To Be Continued…\n\nRadiaLumia — Joerg Student, Jesse Silver and FoldHaus Collective\n\nRE-CYCLONE — Martin Taylor and Chromaforms Art Collective\n\nScriptorium — Gray Davidson, Misha Naiman and Majorelle Arts\n\nSingularity — Rebekah Waites\n\nStardust — Paige Tashner\n\nThe Great Train Wreck — Jeremy Evans, Debby Brower and Collaborative Artisans Reno-Sacramento\n\nTrace — Kate Greenberg and the Dust Crusaders\n\nTree of Life — Tyler Rivenbark, Frida Ticehurst and Institute for Human Creativity\n\nArt Gallery\n\nThe Gallery includes all the presenters listed above plus:\n\nBig Pollinator — Jakob Bokulich\n\nBloom — Peter Hazel\n\nB.Ÿ.T.E. — Andrew Lazorchak\n\nJokeatron 5200 — Natali Leduc and American Consumer Consortium\n\nKaleidoscope — Greg Barron\n\nLet U.S. Prey — Mr & Mrs Ferguson Art\n\nOdd Jelly Out — uckiood — Missy Douglas and Kim Rask\n\nRainbow Bridge — Josh Zubkoff\n\nResolute Arch — Richard Rhodes\n\nRing Theory — John Pertsch\n\nSkull on Wheels — Paul Duncker\n\nSpider Sweet — Bryan Argabrite and Chelsea Argabrite\n\nThe Intersection — Timur Kadyrov and Liya Iva\n\nTranscendent Souls — Nicole Ashton Martin\n\nWrong Desert — Wesley Skinner\n\nPlus coffee service by Dust City Diner!\n\nTop image: RadiaLumia by the FoldHaus Collective",
