  "content": "I’m always on the lookout for stories about Burning Man, and one day an item from Senior Housing News lit up my phone. It was about a group of retirees planning to go to Burning Man for the first time, thanks to a program organized by Juniper Communities, an assisted living organization with facilities in several states.\n\nI tracked down the trip’s organizer, Cindy Longfellow, a cheerful and curious woman in her mid-50s. Cindy had never been to Burning Man but was on point making sure her crew of 15 seniors — four were over 80 — had a safe, fun and memorable time, all while making a bigger statement about the vibrancy and vitality of older people via their camp, Aging Insurrection.\n\nThough they paired up with a more experienced camp, organizers still used common sense when deciding which residents would be best suited for an adventure like this. “We wanted to be inclusive, and yet we couldn’t take someone whose health would be problematic in an extreme environment,” Longfellow said. “A 20-year-old with asthma is not the right person to go to Burning Man, and that’s the same for someone in their 70s and 80s.”\n\nSo how did they fare? Longfellow reports back below, and I’d like to throw in a symbolic fist-bump for Best Camp Spirit. If you were lucky enough to stumble upon their Generational Coloring Party, you were immediately enveloped by their generosity, delight and kindness. The setting may have been novel, but the spirit was as strong as ever.\n\n(Top photo by Lynne Katzmann)",
