  "content": "Vanderbilt Professor of History Michael Bess is the author of Our Grandchildren Redesigned: Life in the Bioengineered Society of the Near Future (Beacon Press, 2015), and the forthcoming book What makes us human? From neurons to the Sistine Chapel.  He is the technologies that may destroy us, including artificial intelligence and genetic engineering.\n\nThe risks of catastrophic failures, he says, are significant — basically our newest technologies are a car without a brake, and if you drive one of those too fast, you’re probably going to crash. Anyone interested in the survival of our species should be asking ourselves: how do we slow down enough to understand what the problems we’re really facing are?\n\nBut there are other, more subtle, challenges to human nature from new technologies. The use of automation can make us increasingly automated; the more we interact with robots, which have a limited range of responses, the more robotic we habitually become. Social media and always-connected devices can create new addictions, subverting our free will.\n\nIf you were to take a hard look at your own behavior, how much of your life would you discover is already on autopilot? How much of a robot are you already, and what’s causing it?\n\nMichael Bess talks with us about human nature and emerging technologies in this podcast from the Burning Man Philosophical Center.\n\nCover Image: Firmament by Christopher Schardt (photo by Robert Bruce Anderson)",
