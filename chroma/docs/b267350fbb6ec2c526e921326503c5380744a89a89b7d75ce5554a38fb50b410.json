  "content": "So we got our hands on the Who What Where book and checked off the things we thought were interesting.  For Tuesday, those things included getting a lesson in how to tie people up; having our bikes modified by the Pimp My Bike crew, formerly known as Mama Lillith’s Falafel Palace; checking out the hemp beauty bar; getting ourselves new outfits at the Boutique in Center Camp; … (deep breath) … visiting Martini Village for … right, martinis;  … and saying hello to the lovely folks at Beaverton.\n\nBut.\n\nUm.\n\nForget the list. On the playa, other things happen. The playa will lead you where you need to go.\n\nAnd that was just the morning.\n\nWe’ll see you again soon we hope. But right now it’s happy hour.\n\nThe playa will provide.",
