The struggle inherent to the duality of the human condition is expressed by the violence of the raw plasma-cut, bolted steel exterior, in contrast with the vitality of the interior blood-red mirror. As visitors gather inside the vibrant core of the sculpture, their myriad reflections remind us of our shared genetic bond and our shared humanity,” says the artist Kate Raudenbush.\n\n“This is the third Burning Man art installation to come to Reno through the collaboration of the Civic Art Program of the Black Rock Arts Foundation, the non-profit art organization of Burning Man, and The City of Reno Arts and Culture Commission’s grant program. Duel Nature supports the mission of the Reno Arts program to involve its citizens in the community’s cultural life and encourage artistic excellence,” said Maria Partridge, Reno project liaison for BRAF and Advisory board member.\n\n“We believe the exhibition of Duel Nature during Artown will serve the community in many ways,” said Crimson Rose, Member of the Board of Directors, BRAF and Board Member and Art Director for Burning Man. “By enhancing civic space through the temporary transformation of an empty lot into an inviting art park and creating a creative gathering spot for Reno citizens with weekly performances and workshops that provide entertainment and interactive possibilities that the community can enjoy for free.”\n\nFor additional photos and information about Duel Nature\n\nphoto: Kate Raudenbush",
