  "content": "In days, there will be a gathering of people in the Black Rock Desert celebrating and putting into practice a culture of creativity, innovation and connection. The Burning Man Project has been supporting and encouraging this Burning Man cultural movement since 1986. Burning Man migrated from the beach in San Francisco, to the Nevada desert and then out into the world.\n\nSpecific to Black Rock City this year, we can’t wait for the Curiouser & Curiouser convening. We expect the metropolis to bring together nearly 70,000 participants including similar levels of first-time Burners on playa as in the past. Those who are new will discover as they acculturate with the Survival Guide what community—at Burning Man events and in the world—is truly all about: storytelling, celebration and laughter, informality and care of others, generosity, kindness, and collective effort. Let’s remember, we were all newbies once, and with that wide-eyed expression caught up in awe and joy we went on to do more and bigger things.\n\nFrom building a wilderness camping experience in Black Rock City as an experiment in civics, to achieving our nonprofit goals, no one said it would be easy. And, the goal remains the same–to make the world better. The key to our collective success is the long-term survival of the Burning Man culture and our continued ability to inspire participation—in Northern Nevada and globally.\n\nBurning Man culture is more relevant than ever—this is exactly what it offers through art, music, learning, leadership and civic engagement.\n\nIn the early years, annual ticket revenue was sufficient, but it alone does not fund Black Rock City and all the other ways the nonprofit brings Burning Man culture to the world. Since becoming a nonprofit in 2011, philanthropic support has been increasingly vital. It is even more important today given lower ticket sales to this year’s event.\n\nIt is easy to hypothesize about why we’re in this moment, but let’s not forget that while the movement is vibrant, any culture is impacted by what is happening in broader society. Moods and societal values change, economic forecasts and consumer confidence fluctuates, local, state and federal laws shift, the weather patterns become unpredictable, and costs rise, but one thing remains: Our passion and commitment to bringing more Burning Man culture to the world is steadfast.\n\nJudging by the outpouring of community response to our extended ticket sales—including the return of in-person sales at beloved locations in San Francisco and Reno—and the invitation to share music line-ups earlier than usual, it’s clear you care deeply about what we are doing to safeguard the future, and how you can be involved in it.\n\nWhen ticket sales slowed for this year’s gathering, we leaned into radical inclusion. We helped more people discover that this could be their year to make it to Black Rock City. Because we are deeply committed to managing ticket prices in a way that facilitates a citizenry from diverse economic backgrounds, we re-opened the Ticket-Aid program for low-income $225 tickets, while at the same time kept $575 and $1,500 tickets available for purchase. Is this the year that a friend of yours can finally come to the desert?\n\nTo the Burning Man Project, the future includes prototyping the community and regenerative practices of tomorrow, particularly in Northern Nevada; acting as an effective steward with the global network to increase and expand upon the relevancy and meaning of Burning Man culture; and creating more lower barrier opportunities to engage with the community and the culture while, across all we do, leaning into the bleeding edge of collaboration and co-creation that will enable the handoff to the next generation.\n\nBurning Man isn’t easy. It is a badge of pride to get out of your bubble and convene, create and innovate with people of different interests, backgrounds and beliefs, but it sure is worth taking the risk. The reward is personal growth and communal benefit—oh, and a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nJoin in understanding the opportunity for more Burning Man in the world, in exploring how you can play a part, and how you can support the movement beyond Black Rock City. Communities are built on the recognition of the unique abilities of every member, and I thank you for being a part of Burning Man!\n\nHope to see you out in the world,\nMarian Goodell\nAugust 18, 2024",
