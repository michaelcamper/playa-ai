  "content": "The Accuracy Third podcast is back with a second season of stories from Black Rock City. Join Rex, D-Day and Beth for stories from the individuals who make Burning Man happen, Theme Camp implosions, and so much grand failed art.\n\nS02 E01 – The Volare\n\nFor those who know The Volare, neither it nor its owner need any introduction. For those who don’t, The Volare is Black Rock City’s very own Batmobile/Chitty Chitty Bang Bang hybrid, and Coyote is its Dr. Frankenstein, as well as the superintendent of Black Rock City. He’s the man behind the men and women of DPW, the author of Coyote Nose: Tales of the Early Desert Carnies of Burning Man, and an honest to goodness legend of the playa, depending on who you talk to (D-Day & Rex talked to Coyote.)\n\nS02 E02 – Illumination, Navigation, and Celebration\n\nThey are the guardians of one of the longest running continuous rituals of Black Rock City. The Lamplighters bring light to the playa, as well as their legendary 21-hour-a-day bar. Learn about how to volunteer for the Man, the parties they don’t throw anymore and why, different uses for the Temple, and everything you didn’t know about the rich history of the Lamplighters told to you by one of their own, a delightful man named Moonbeam. There’s a lot about lanterns in this episode, though you’ll find that D-Day and Rex can’t manage to describe one.\n\nS03 E03 – Is it your story?\n\nIt could be!
