Several new co-plaintiffs have joined the suit: the Summit Lake Paiute Tribe, the Gerlach Preservation Society, and local Gerlach residents and property owners Will Roger Peterson, Nanci Peterson, Stacey Black, Margie Reynolds, Jason Walters, and Dave Cooper. The amended complaint can be read in its entirety here.\n\nBurning Man Project, Friends of Nevada Wilderness, Friends of the Black Rock High Rock, land owner David Jamieson, and local official and Gerlach resident Andy Moore have filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for their handling of a proposed geothermal exploration project in Gerlach, Nevada. The proposed project would permanently alter the viewshed, deplete the local springs and water supply, and fundamentally change the quality of life for Gerlach residents and visitors.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on the grounds that BLM didn’t consider the full scope of effects and illegally segmented the project to avoid conducting a more rigorous Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The plaintiffs in this case and residents in Gerlach — a town of approximately 120 people — agree that BLM’s monitoring and mitigation conditions for the geothermal project are lacking, and that comments from a concerned public were ignored. The Finding of No Significant Impact was made without consideration of cumulative impacts or geographic context.\n\nEven renewable energy projects must be studied and located in such a way as to minimize harm to the environment and the local community. This is an industrial project on the border of one of America’s pristine conservation areas, established for the purpose of preserving the view and natural environment.\n\nBLM approved the drilling of thirteen 2.1-acre wells drilled to 1,500 to 7,500 feet spanning 2,742 acres in Gerlach, adjacent to the ecologically sensitive Black Rock Desert High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area (NCA). The co-plaintiffs have strong concerns about the adverse environmental, economic and social impacts of this project, and have asked BLM to conduct due diligence to ensure the region is not adversely affected. BLM completed a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement for the Burning Man event in 2019, a week-long Leave No Trace event. An EIS is needed under conditions where permanent infrastructure will be constructed in the area of a small town and unique national resource.\n\nGerlach is a small rural town of 120 people, known by residents and visitors alike for its quality of life, natural environment, remote location, and sweeping vistas. The region is also known for its dark skies, which, when unobstructed by light pollution from industrial activity, offer exceptional opportunities for stargazing and amateur astronomy. Gerlach is known as the “darkest town in the country” and part of only seven Dark Sky Sanctuaries in the entire world.\n\nGerlach resident and Gerlach-Empire Citizens Advisory Board member Andy Moore joined the lawsuit out of concern for the permanent effects to his town and the region he loves. “No one I know is against green power. What we are against is a company coming in, disregarding our public input, ignoring our questions, giving false statements, and damaging a community in order to fill their shareholders’ pockets while destroying our quiet nights, our property values, and our peace. There is no gain for this town, only loss from this project at our expense and way of life.”\n\nIn greenlighting the project, BLM dismissed the cultural and recreational value of the town of Gerlach and disregarded the detrimental economic impact that could occur if tourism falters from loss of the dark skies designation or depleting the local springs and water supply. BLM offered no solution to local concerns about a diminished quality of life during construction, or in the aftermath — whether the project is abandoned or a power generation facility is built. This lawsuit is a response to BLM’s deficient process.\n\nEarlier this week on January 11, over 70 Gerlach residents and guest speakers attended a public meeting to share thoughts and concerns about the potential short-term and long-term negative effects of Ormat’s proposed project. Concerns included potential erosion of the local watershed, incessant noise from construction and drilling, light pollution, habitat damage, and more. Community members expressed that their concerns have been ignored by BLM and Ormat for the past two years as Ormat has developed this project.\n\nFriends of the Black Rock High Rock is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Gerlach whose mission is inspiring a legacy of public land stewardship through conservation and education. Executive Director Stacey Wittek said, “The potential impact to this region can’t be overstated. Gerlach depends on tourism, and tourists come here for the small town feel and abundant access to sustainable recreational and educational opportunities. Our organization supports renewable energy in Nevada, but even renewable energy projects need to be studied and located in a way that doesn’t harm the environment or ruin the local community.”\n\nGerlach is the gateway to the extraordinary 800,000-acre public lands of the Black Rock Desert High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails NCA. These arid landscapes are home to sensitive species, hot springs, canyons, 120 miles of emigrant trails, historical wagon trails, and prehistoric Lake Lahontan, the expansive playa where the annual Black Rock City event takes place each year. Many groups work and recreate in this area year-round, including ranchers, rocketeers, artists, astronomers, hikers, and off-highway vehicle operators. Public lands and small towns are essential to the character of the American West, and we want to help protect the unique resources in this area of Northern Nevada.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability — including renewable energy — is one of Burning Man Project’s top priorities. Written in 2019, the 10-year Environmental Sustainability Roadmap has ambitious goals. We are taking our Gerlach operations and our BRC operations off of fossil fuels, as part of a long-term goal to make Black Rock City carbon negative.
