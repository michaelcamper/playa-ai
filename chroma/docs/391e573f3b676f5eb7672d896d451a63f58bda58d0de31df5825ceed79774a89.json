  "content": "I have been hearing more and more reports of people being dosed without them knowing.  Some people may think that secretly giving someone a drug experience is a gift, but it is NOT.  Non-consensual dosing is “Consciousness Rape.”\n\nIn fact, ANYTHING wonderful can be terrible if given without consent. Sex, Drugs, even a cool spritz of water – can be a nightmare.  In this Tips & Tricks installment, Halcyon talks about how self-expression requires consent when it affects another.\n\nSearch this site for all of Halcyon’s Burning Man Tips & Tricks.",
