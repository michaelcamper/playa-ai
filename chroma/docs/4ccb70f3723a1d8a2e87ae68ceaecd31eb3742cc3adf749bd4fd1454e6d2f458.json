  "content": "Update 8/23: If you are traveling to the Burning Man event, we’ve sent out detailed information about what to do to prepare for your drive and any encounter with law enforcement. We are encouraging participants to safely record their interactions with law enforcement officers (do not hold your phone in your hands while driving).\n\nIf you’ve made a recording of an interaction with law enforcement en route (safely, please!), name the file with your name and the date (e.g. “Kelly_Burner_08-23-18.mp4”) and upload it to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. Please email the link to that file, along with your full legal name and address and the date when the encounter occurred to traffic2018@burningman.org.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior, is conducting intensive law enforcement operations on Highway 447 in Wadsworth and Nixon. Many of these stops progress into lengthy vehicle searches, and they are using dogs to inspect vehicles. We’ve been told this operation will continue throughout the week and possibly into next week, when the Burning Man event is officially underway.\n\nWhile we respect and appreciate the important work of law enforcement, we are greatly concerned by the real and potential negative impacts of this surge in activity.\n\nOver the next seven days, we anticipate more than 60,000 people will drive Highway 447 on their way to the Black Rock Desert. The frequency and intensity of stops is already having, and will continue to have, negative implications and effects. We have shared all of the following concerns with the BIA:\n\nSome of the purported reasons provided for the traffic stops include: driving over the posted speed limit, not stopping at the line at a stop sign, crossing the centerline or a tire touching the centerline, partially obscured license plates, not using turn signals, dim and non-functioning lights. These stops often involve police dogs and lengthy vehicle searches, and we have received numerous reports that the police dogs often provide false alerts. We have also received numerous accounts from our staff, contractors and volunteers that they were not breaking any traffic laws when they were stopped. Given the large number of individuals who have reported being stopped when they were not violating any laws, we believe these tactics are overly aggressive, unconstitutional, unnecessary, pretextual and unacceptable.\n\nYou might be wondering why this is all happening. So are we. We think the BIA’s efforts to target our community as we prepare for our annual gathering on public lands are misguided.\n\nWhile BLM law enforcement has conducted aggressive traffic enforcement in past years on Gate Road in Black Rock City, this is the first time the Burning Man event has been targeted for an operation of this magnitude on public highways. The BIA stops appear to be pretextual and not based on actual violations of law. Event organizers and many regional law enforcement agencies were not consulted or notified in advance, so there was no possibility of any planning to mitigate impacts on the local communities and on event infrastructure.\n\nThe Burning Man organization does not condone any illegal activity. We urge our participants to obey all local, state, and federal laws, and we appreciate the role of law enforcement. We are also, however, very concerned about the current and potential safety and operational impacts of the Bureau of Indian Affairs operation, particularly as we ramp up to our busiest time on site.\n\nPeople who are stopped on their way to or from the Burning Man event are invited to complete our Law Enforcement Feedback Form. Whether the experience was negative or positive, we would like to hear about it.",
