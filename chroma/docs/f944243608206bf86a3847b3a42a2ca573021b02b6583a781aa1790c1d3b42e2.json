  "content": "The Burning Man was eighty feet high\n\nAtop a temple of Moorish lace\n\nConfections of stars and midnight suns\n\nAll on a lake bed flat and sere, already\n\nOld when primates first appeared.\n\nFire dancers whirled as the stars chirped\n\nHosannas to the primal rite.\n\nNothing is lost, but all is gained,\n\nExtravagance is the law of the land.\n\nOpen now, as the clouds pass by,\n\nFire is water, and water itself\n\nSoars into the stratosphere.\n\nHigh art falls into the dust,\n\nNo one complains, and all rejoice.\n\nSurreal it is, and yet romantic,\n\nBacchus himself rides on the wind,\n\nAnd here it is that once a year\n\nArtists bring about the birth\n\nOf Shivaâ€™s endless pillar of fire.\n\nby Gawaine Caldwater Ross",
