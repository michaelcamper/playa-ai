  "content": "Calling all artists!\n\nYou’ve asked, and we’ve listened! This year we are hosting our first art grants workshop. Come hear from those involved in the Black Rock Arts Foundation’s and Burning Man’s grant processes about what is needed to create a successful grant proposal. You’ll be given a chance to ask questions about the mandatory grant forms — why we ask certain questions, what information we are looking for, how to get those character specs to work, and more. If you can’t make it to the event, don’t worry! Send in your question by Wednesday, January 12th and it will be answered during the workshop. The workshop will be recorded, and a video posted on the Burning Man website shortly after the event.\n\nThis workshop is not open to the general public … only artists who are working on grant applications for Burning Man and BRAF.\n\nAfter the workshop, please join us for the Art Lounge. This event is a social mixer for artists who created work for Burning Man last year and/or are planning art projects this coming year. Your creative spirit gives so much to Black Rock City and the world, that we want to thank you for your inventiveness and resourcefulness. It is also for Art Department volunteers who assist artists on the playa with a dedication and creative energy all their own. We hope this will be an opportunity to meet one another and spark increased creative cross-pollination and collaboration.\n\nPlease  join the Burning Man staff, members of the Art Department and ARTery volunteers, for a little reception for our yearly gathering in appreciation of YOU.\n\nAt approximately 7:30pm there will be brief introductions and a short talk about this year’s theme: “Rites of Passage”.\n\nTo attend, please RSVP to rsvp-specialevents@burningman.com.  It’s an intimate space, and we need an exact number to plan for.\n\nThanks and hope to see you there!!!\n\nNOTE: This is not the place to review specific art grant proposals with Art Staff, though staff will be on hand who can answer basic questions regarding the process.\n\nRemember, the deadline to submit art grant proposals for BRAF is January 15th, and for Burning Man this year it’s February 1st.\n\nHope to see you there!!\n\nBurning Man and BRAF Art Grant Workshop and Art Lounge\nWHEN: Thursday, January 13th\nGrant Workshop 5:30 to 7 pm\nArt Lounge 7 pm to 9 pm\nWHERE:  Mission Rock Cafe  817 Terry Francois Blvd San Francisco, CA (Map) 415.626.5355\nYou must RSVP if you wish to attend.
