  "content": "Boundless Space…. what a whirlwind of a week. I experienced an out-of-the-box collision of two worlds with more in common than one may think. The collaboration brought together Sotheby’s, one of the oldest auction houses in the world, and Burning Man, one of the largest and most unique experiences driven by artists and creatives. It was a partnership I’m sure many would never expect — except Fab 5 Freddy, the connector behind the project.\n\nWhile some Burners weren’t so sure how to feel about this collab, I think the auction’s mission to bring together and support artists from around the world with a major focus on BIPOC and women artists, fusing up-and-coming and well-known artist of all mediums, definitely deserved a chance.\n\nIt’s not often many of us get the opportunity to have our work sold in the secondary art market. This was a huge deal for me, and I’m sure many others. To be among artists who have made such a name for themselves, both on playa and in the default world, was a lot to take in.\n\nThe secondary art market, according to Private Art Investor magazine, “involves the resale of artworks, either through private sales or auction houses. Many secondary market dealers have little contact with artists, and they rarely sell a work at a lower price with the hopes of developing an artist’s career.”\n\nAs one of the up-and-coming artists to join this exhibit, I can say firsthand that I would have had a very small chance to be associated with Sotheby’s at this stage in my career. That was a huge factor for saying yes to what otherwise seemed like such an unlikely and uncertain pairing.\n\nI also considered how Burning Man Project could be a space that supported artists in ways other than art on playa; Boundless Space would be an experiment of what that could look like. This was a way to support the artists who do so much for the greater community, many of whom get overlooked. It was also a huge opportunity to introduce Burning Man to non-Burner artists while supporting many artists from around the world.\n\nIt was lovely to see other Black women artists included in the show. I look forward to seeing an increase in diversity — and in particular, Black women in future collaborations that support artists — in galleries and Black Rock City. I hope Boundless Space will help facilitate that change.\n\nThis weekend’s collision of two worlds was evident not only in the art and artists included in the auction, but in the reinvention and activation of the gallery space itself. Normally five floors of stark, white walls — with only the loan sound of your footsteps as music to your ears — the third floor of Sotheby’s NYC became instantly filled with colors, sounds, and people adorned in eccentric and vibrant styles. It was a true Burning Man takeover.\n\nAn orange wall tapestry took up half the main room, casting its color to tint the walls. There were vintage furniture and rugs, live performances, DJs, sound healing sessions, dance parties on the rooftop, workshops, and panel discussions. Something was happening at almost every moment of the day, often many things at once — in true Burner style. Art mediums ranged from photography — such as the pieces I contributed from @blackburnerproject — to beautiful jewelry, paintings, and sculptures. The variety of art featured in this auction and gallery exhibit was vast and complex.\n\nOn top of immersing myself in the beautiful art, I found this weekend to be full of connecting and networking with so many amazing people, artists, and art lovers. The offsite gatherings were just as important as what took place within the walls of Sotheby’s.\n\nI would enter the beautiful homes of people I’d never met, who welcomed me and others in, ready and prepared to host us all. This is where I was able to have longer, deeper conversations with people I didn’t see or get to meet at Sotheby’s. I was adorned with a gold LOVE necklace created by Laura Kimpton as a gift she gave out over the week. Julia Whitelaw, co-creator of “Bliss Dance” gave me valuable advice about my art piece idea. I met and got to know artist Quest Skinner, with her dynamic personality, for the first time. And I heard some stories of Burning Man from D.A. of Black Rock and his sisters (I may have successfully convinced them to return to Black Rock City in 2022). Love, support, and community was definitely in the air… and oh-so needed.\n\nI also had the pleasure of hosting, producing, and moderating my first panel discussion which, luckily, was the success I’d envisioned it to be. The support was overwhelming. I have my amazing panel guests to thank for such a dynamic and much-needed conversation. Thanks to actor Mehcad Brooks, artist & activist Favianna Rodriguez, and DJ & NAACBurners Camp member Jason Victor, for bringing such amazing energy with deep and authentic stories and conversation to Sotheby’s. I don’t know if anyone was prepared to learn and be inspired as much as we all did by discussing the importance of diversity at Burning Man and healing in BIPOC communities. I for one would have never envisioned the first panel I’d produce, with conversations about diversity, to take place at Sotheby’s. I’m thankful for it.\n\nPhotographer Karston Tannis attended the panel on Sunday to explore what Burning Man was all about: “I loved seeing the variety of art and most importantly hearing about the healing properties, closure, and bonding that Burning Man fosters.”\n\nAnd now, with the lots closed — it’s Friday, October 8th, about a quarter past noon Eastern Time here — I am able to think about the event in its entirety. There was a lot that went into this, both pre-event and throughout the week. I could see it on everyone’s faces, working to make it grand, tapping people that they knew, doing what they could to get bids. With that being said, there were many lessons learned as a new artist exhibiting my work. I’m sure even more for the nonprofit Burning Man Project, for Sotheby’s, and for the Burner fam community who contributed to putting this on. Some of my takeaways: regardless of the status of any institution, don’t expect too much. Come prepared, and speak up to ensure your vision is being executed. Things weren’t perfect, but I think the mishaps will lead to even better collaborations in the future.\n\nArtist Quest Skinner who contributed the Mermaid to the auction was excited for the opportunity and spent several months preparing for it. She is, however, looking forward to seeing how this experience shapes the future of Burning Man culture. She hopes this leads to opportunities to do something even bigger and better. “Ultimately, I walked away feeling confident and proud of my work and the spirit of our community.”\n\nBoundless Space… The Possibilities of Burning Man — some Burners understand what that may look like. This weekend was, for many others, the first introduction to Burning Man, and it has them truly wondering… “just what possibilities are there?”\n\n(Unless otherwise noted, all images courtesy of Erin Douglas, 2021)",
