  "content": "We’re postponing launch of the Secure Ticket Exchange Program (STEP) for at least 24 hours until we resolve an issue relating to people who’ve used Gmail to register a Burner Profile in the past two weeks.\n\nGmail users have not been receiving confirmation emails that allow them to complete their Burner Profile account, or request a password reset. Because STEP — which is linked to Burner Profiles — is a first-come, first-served system, we want to ensure people using Gmail are fully registered before launching the program.\n\nWe expect to have this resolved quickly and will update this post to announce a new launch date and time for STEP.\n\nUPDATE: Monday, April 21, at 12pm (noon) PDT, STEP will open to participants who want to submit their tickets for resale. The following day, Tuesday, April 22, at 12pm (noon) PDT, participants wishing to purchase tickets will be able to register for STEP. Full details on the ticket page.",
