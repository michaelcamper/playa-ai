I do. It started with an artist friend leaving the city where we’d met and travelling across the country, then calling me, months later, from far away to tell me there was gathering of artists in the desert that I absolutely had to see.\n\nI said no. Or rather, I said “yeeeaaaaaaaah, I don’t think that’s gonna happen …”\n\nBut she kept persisting. She got me to come to some regional events. And then … through a confluence of bizarre circumstances, I found myself in San Francisco, with a ticket in my hand, looking for a ride.\n\nThen there was the experience itself: the trip into the desert, the line of fellow pilgrims, the gate with its guardians, the clear threshold — manned by greeters — to tell me I had no arrived somewhere unlike any other place I had been …\n\nAnd the thing is, however distinct and weird my story is … does it seem all that unusual to you? In fact, the more you hear the stories of how people got to Burning Man, the more you think (at least I do) that however distinct they may be, they also have a lot in common.\n\nBurning Man tech staff member Anselm Engle (who says he told his friend ““yeeeaaaaaaaah, I don’t think that’s gonna happen …”” for a full 12 years) put the pieces together, suggesting that the experience of going to Burning Man is itself a manifestation of the “Hero’s Journey” — a kind of mythical journey common to most (or even all) cultures.\n\nThe term was coined by legendary scholar of comparative religions Joseph Campbell in his book “The Hero With a Thousand Faces,” and it posits that common mythical structures exist in the collective unconscious of humanity, and that they manifest in our myths and legends. The Hero’s Journey, Campbell said, generally includes:\n\nAnd really, this covers my personal journey to and from Burning Man really well — not just the first time (though especially that) but most of the times. And, Anselm suggested, it actually maps pretty well to most people’s experiences.\n\nWe don’t need to read too much into this: it may be that this is simply the way human beings tell these kinds of stories, that this says more about our capacity to turn experiences into narratives than it does about Burning Man itself. But even so — this means that to go to Burning Man is to partake in an annual hero’s journey, shared by thousands, a ritual trip … undertaking no small amount of hardship and inconvenience … to a strange underworld in which our experience of ourselves and the world around us changes, and we return to the communities from when we came bearing new kinds of experiences.\n\nAnd some of us are good with that. And others do it again, and again.\n\nIt’s something to think about during this year’s Radical Ritual theme. Anselm talks us through the implications of this way of thinking about Burning Man, in a Philosophical Center podcast.",
