  "content": "We’ve talked a lot about trash: how to reduce it, ways to manage it, and where to take it after Burning Man is over. The latter is always the biggest challenge, year after year.\n\nNew this year: The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe’s stores on Highway 447 in Nixon and Wadsworth will be accepting Burner refuse for 24 hours a day, starting Saturday of the Burn until Tuesday after the event (more details below).\n\nThe program is offered through the Public Utilities Department (PUD) of the Tribe and is designed to target last year’s issue of nasty overflowing dumpsters at both stores.  The PUD will have dumpsters at both stores again, but this year they will man those stores for 24 hours a day, Saturday of the Man Burn thru Tuesday post event. The PUD will charge $5.00 for regular and properly bagged refuse. They will also accept (but charge more for) carpet ($25), sofas, bedding, etc.  Check out both stores on Highway 447 to properly dispose of your trash, support the tribe and grab a snack for the road.  And don’t forget to say “THANK YOU!”\n\nThe Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe (PLPT) has lived here for thousands of years. The land we travel through–and the land we camp on–is considered sacred and has always been theirs. Visit the Paiute Tribe’s website to learn more about their history, Pyramid Lake, their business amenities, and the incredible work they do with endangered and ancient trout.  By providing trash services to Burners, this year the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe (PLPT) is raising money for the community while doing you a BIG favor. Don’t forget to say thank you!\n\nDetails on trash drop-off:\n\nWays to say “thanks”:\n\nA final reminder: Nixon is 60 miles from Gerlach. Your trash needs to be secured well enough to make that 60 mile drive. There is no place to drop trash near the Black Rock Desert. Pack it out!",
