  "content": "By John Curley and Hannah Miller\n\nThe Global Leadership Conference is about a lot of things. That was never more true than what took place on Friday afternoon at the Ignite session, where all the conference attendees sat in an auditorium-like space and listened to one speaker after another talk about what inspired them, what motivated them, what they had learned as they pursued life and the arts.\n\nBrady Forrest\nThe Evolution of Ignite Talks\nBrady Forrest introduced the audience to the concept of the Ignite talk: five minutes, with 20 mandatory slides. The format encourages speakers to keep moving and use visuals, and has now been used in 50 Ignite talks around the country. The real point of Ignite, said Brady, is that “anyone can be a rockstar.”\n\nDanielle Leong\nCorpse Party Bugs\nDanielle laid down the ecosystem your body turns into after death. Within 10 days, it teems with maggots, ants, carrion beetles, and then a long beautiful process of increasing putrefaction: putrefaction (when your body bloats), black putrefaction (when your body explodes) and butyric fermentation, when your body starts to smell like cheese. (Danielle did not specify which cheese.) It’s transformation in reverse. Starting with the end at the beginning.\n\nA Human/ Robert MacPherson\nPermaKulcha\nRobert related the staging of a successful event like Burning Man to raising a successful garden. First, you have to put the right things in the right places. You don’t plants ferns in the desert, for example. Not going to work. Then, you must value the diversity of different plants, because some will let you do things that others won’t. But one of his underlying beliefs was that to have success, you really need to find the lazy way of doing things; they make the most sense, and you don’t wind up fighting yourself or the environment. Let the site – and the event – find its own way. It’ll be the strongest it can be.\n\nBen Rudnick/Captain Gonzo\nFIGMENT – Water, Fire & Taking Over the World one heart at a time\nCaptain Gonzo spoke of the miracle that is Figment, at 11 cities and counting. Figment New York, where adults and children are stranded on an island with only art to look at. Figment Jackson, Mississippi: created from one sole Burner. Pittsburgh, Philly, Detroit, Chicago, DC – and in Boston, where it was adopted by the city government and made into the official, municipal New Years’ celebration. Their newest creation, Figment Alpha, is centered on the idea that everyone is a leader.\n\nTaylor Bollinger\nBurn Feels/Burn Speak\nBollinger is a cognitive linguist who shared with the Ignite crowd ideas on handling the inevitable conflicts that arise in even the most collaborative settings. He put together a toolkit that participants could take back to their Regionals, or onto the play.  Alas, even his most powerful tools, he said, were not enough to save his most recent relationship. But let’s press onward anyway; here are the approaches he encourages people to use:\n1) Mindfulness: keep things in the present tense, and stay focused on the problem in front of you\n2) Intentional: When you are arguing, don’t say things you don’t mean\n3) Responsible: Maintain your internal locus of control\n4) Grateful: Find something that is not so bad about the situation, and everyone, including yourself, will feel better about it.\n\nSchuyler Earl\nThe First Moment in the Universe\nSchuyler Earl started with a viral Youtube video of an astrophysicist receiving confirmation that his theory was correct. You might have seen it. (Watch it first.) Then he took us back to the era, about 100 years ago, when human beings thought that the Milky Way was the entire universe, but then started noticing spiral nebulae out there in the distance. From there it was a story of human beings staring farther and farther into space, following light back through billions of years, finally reaching the farthest reaches of the universe, thereby returning to the beginning of time.\n\nStefan Pildes\nHula Hoops\nPassion can flow through anything. It can be about anything. It can go around and around your body with rainbow colored electric lights. In Stefan Pildes’ demonstration/talk, he covered the Big Bang of the Hula Hoop movement, which in his case was sparked by a bunch of New Yorkers convening on a park after 9-11 and responding by – hula hooping. “I don’t care what your passion is,” he said. “Find it and use it to change the world.”\n\nPaul Salazar\nThe Beauty of Eclipses\nHere was another panelist who had never been to Burning Man, and yet the enthusiasm and energy that powered his talk was infectious, and he was preaching to a sympathetic crowd. … The playa is full of serendipitous moments, and Salazar noted the serendipity of the sun being 400 times larger than the Earth, because when the moon crosses between the two bodies, the corona that forms is just perfect, and it wouldn’t happen if the sun were any bigger or smaller. There’s a moment that eclipse aficionados love, the “diamond ring” they call it, when the last rays of the sun pass through the mountains of the moon, and shine brilliantly atop the ring of the moon. Then, totality, and the transformation is complete. Again with the transformation – a common theme with many of the Ignite presentations.\n\nAdam Ebel\nMy Evolution as an Artist\nAdam started with a revoked citizenship and ended in the Playa. He talked about his grandfatherbeing stripped of German citizenship by the Nazis because he was Jewish, but then went through his career on the Playa: robots emerging from the ground, the Heart Deco bus, and culminating in the Phoenix imagery (which is on the flag of San Francisco). “Never forget the beauty inside you,” he said.\n\nPaul Weir\nAll Souls\nIn 1983, Paul was legally dead for 17 minutes, and since that time his life has been … you guessed it … transformed. He has taken that energy and poured it into the All Souls Procession in Tucson, a heartfelt outpouring of civic engagement centered around one of the few things we all share – death. In the leadup to the event, 10,000 mementos are gathered – they could be anything; bits of clothing, papers, notes, letters, any reminder of someone who has left us. These fragments of lives are gathered into a huge urn that is torched on the last night of the All Souls event. “It’s very beautiful, and it’s very deep,” Weir said. The big burn isn’t the only thing that happens; there are eight weeks of workshops that residents can take for free, and the city has responded. Attendance has reached 10,000 people.\n\nBobby Hedglin\nVirgin Outings\nNew York City has developed an airlock for virgin Burners: a months long acculturation process to bring in the virgins, rub them until they are warm, and get them in the mood. “I asked so many questions my first year, that’s how I ended up doing this,” Bobby said. “We get them to ask their Burning questions.” They do boozy brunches, and the usual camping trip, but what really makes it work are the mani/pedis they go get at a local salon. “The straight guys loved the manipedis,” he said, showing a slide of yes, a line of assumably straight dudes getting pedicures.\n\nWally Bomgaars (Odwally)\nInterjecting Positive Messages\nWhat if the next message that appeared on your cellphone screen didn’t say that someone has connected with you on LinkedIn or commented on your post on Facebook or that you are supposed to be in a meeting in 10 minutes. What if that pop-up said something like, “Make someone feel awesome right now,” or “Breathe,” or “Be Grateful for your Friends.” Do you think it would make a difference in your life? Wally says yes. “Positive thinking has a powerful effect on our lives,” he said, and he displayed a helpful graphic with a very strong arrow pointing upwards. At the end of his speech, he had the crowd stand and breathe. “Doesn’t that feel good?” Why yes it did.\n\nKaren Cheng\nHow I Learned to Dance in a Year\nHow many times have you tried to do something that you weren’t very good at? The last thing you want is for someone to see you trying. Karen put her embarrassing first try at really complicated dance moves on a giant screen in front of a roomful of tragically hip people, and then the progression to knowing what she’s doing. There’s nothing so cool as someone who will purposefully fall on her ass in public to make all the rest of us feel capable. That is an act of love.  www.Giveit100.com",
