Regional Contact, was working on a pitch for a show about indigenous women and their practices around menstruation, birth, marriage and moon-cycle rituals.\n\nSo she decided to attend the annual 18-day Tribal Gathering Festival, which brings together indigenous cultures and modern tribes to learn, create and celebrate with each other at a beach site three hours north of Panama.\n\n“It’s like connecting with the earth when you connect with the indigenous from all over the world, because their whole way of life is connected to the earth,” Athena explained. “I really felt like every sit-down was with someone who was so much more grounded than I am — and I think I’m grounded,” she added with a laugh.\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nShe spent the first week connecting with representatives from 60 tribes from 35 countries, taking workshops, immersing herself in indigenous beliefs and practices, and interviewing as many women as possible. The second week, more people came to the jungle site, and the gathering morphed into its second planned phase — a psytrance festival.\n\nWhat wasn’t planned was the coronavirus outbreak, which was spreading rapidly and raising alarms worldwide — unbeknownst to the disconnected (and Immediacy-immersed) festival-goers.\n\nWhen it was time to pack it up and head home, the Panamanian police said the Spanish equivalent of “not so fast.”\n\nAnyone who’d been in Panama for more than 14 days and had a flight that day or the next was allowed to leave, although many Tribal Gathering participants still faced challenges getting off the site and out of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of people were required to stay at the festival site, a place that wasn’t prepared to host a large number of people for longer than the event. Government officials offered conflicting advice about what was going on and took passports. Confusion reigned among participants — but, surprisingly, so did calm.\n\n“We had just spent two weeks in this place of sheer love in utopia and cooperation. So any time stressful energy came up, the community was there to immediately call it and bring it down now,” Athena recalled. “It was beautiful. The only chaos that I could see came from the Panamanian officials because they did not know what the fuck to do with us.”\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nThat’s when Athena drew on her can-do instincts, and everything she had learned from running Burning Man Regional events for many years.\n\n“I feel like taking large amounts of chaotic minutia and putting it in order is my superpower,” said Athena, who helped turn a scary situation into one where everyone worked together to create what they needed to survive for an indefinite length of time.\n\nThe festival’s volunteer coordinators had left the premises before the quarantine, so Athena banded with festival organizers and stepped up as community organizer to mobilize attendees.\n\nShe implemented a chalkboard with jobs and shifts, along with an incentive system: if you did eight hours of work, you got three free meals; one meal required four hours. Jobs included disbanding stages, working in the main kitchen, and helping at the pizza, smoothie, chai, and alcohol bars.\n\nThanks to the locals who replenished the produce and other food supplies, the vestiges of the festival almost made it a luxury culinary experience.\n\n“Probably the best food that I ate in the whole time I was in Panama was at that festival,” Athena said. “Vice can just suck it because we were never on rations, ever.”\n\nClick on photos to see details\n\nSadly, the event’s “Leave No Trace” efforts were in disarray. Athena educated the remaining festival-goers about Burning Man’s Leaving No Trace Principle and created a volunteer crew with three others to pick up cigarette butts and trash. By the end of the week, she had a 10-person MOOP team. She felt sure that Leaving No Trace would be a higher priority for the festival in the future.\n\n“Everyone on the team now believes that next year we need to do education around cigarette butts. There were way too many on the ground,” she recalled. “Four women have decided to take that on as the thing they do next year, and coordinate with me. I’m like, ‘Great! Let’s make this happen.’ They’re gonna have a bitchn’ LNT crew.”\n\nAfter about five days, word came that Panama was about to close its borders, and authorities said everyone had to leave. Athena quickly booked a flight for herself and four others. The departure was not seamless: It took hours and some yelling to get their passports back; and various embassies offered different levels of assistance for their citizens.\n\nThen a police escort arrived for the journey to Panama City, the departure point for everyone’s flights. Cruising at 80-90 miles per hour and gliding through checkpoints, Athena said she felt a complete shift in energy, and she began to feel her freedom return.\n\n“It was crazy. I felt like some diplomat, but we were just a bunch of dirty hippies — and we were dirty, let me tell ya,” she laughed. “I mean, we swam in lagoons, we swam in the ocean, and we took showers with watering cans, but we were dirty.”\n\nAthena is now sheltering in place in Mexico and back to work on her show pitch. She’s returned to her day-to-day life with a newfound confidence in her Burner experience and her ability to turn chaos into order under pressure. “Every time I get to use my superpower, it reaffirms that I have it.”\n\nTop photo: Global Tribal Gathering on Colon Beach, Panama by The Nomadic Daughter Photography.
