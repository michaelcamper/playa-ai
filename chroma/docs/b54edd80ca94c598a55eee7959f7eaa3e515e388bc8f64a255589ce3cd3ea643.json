  "content": "[Note:   I have responded to the comments below with a new post, which can be found here.  Also a reminder that I do not, and never have, spoken for the Org.]\n\nI am as shocked as anyone that rich people came to Burning Man and behaved like rich people.\n\nThere’s only one explanation:  it’s a conspiracy, and it goes all the way to the top!  Yes!  The only way people with money could have possibly used that money to try and game the system is if Burning Man was directly involved!  In on it!  We all know it, but you don’t the half of it!\n\nHere are the 5 biggest, most shocking, examples, of plug-and-play malfeasance – and the Burning Man organization’s complicity in it!\n\nWhat is it?  I don’t know!  You don’t know!  But it’s got to be amazing, and we’re not living by it!  Only they are!\n\nThey brought out a bunch of senior citizens to tell everyone on the playa to have-a-nice-day!  They even hugged people!  And then were paid minimum wage!\n\nSure it shot out flames, had a DJ, and Friday night’s Gushing Oil Party was awesome, but that’s not the point!\n\nAnyone who went is now under the terms and conditions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act!  On the plus side, there was no MOOP.\n\nThat giant sculpture with the funky lights that everybody loved?  That was really the Nebraska statehouse.  We were so used!\n\nAnd there’s MORE:\n\nWe can’t let them get away with this!  Obviously we need to fix global income equality!  Or bitch about how Burning Man’s run!  Whichever is easier for us to do on the internet!",
