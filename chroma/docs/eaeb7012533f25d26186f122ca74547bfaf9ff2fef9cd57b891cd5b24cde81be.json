  "content": "Hi, it’s Burning Man. Did you notice this post was for 2016, i.e. a year that already happened? No? Well, it was, so this information is out of date. Info about the 2017 OMG Sale can be found at tickets.burningman.org.\n\nLove,\n\nBurning Man\n\nThe OMG ticket sale is around the corner, and we’re modifying the process just a little to make ticket buying less stressful and more fair.\n\nThe short story: In this sale you will not be gaining access to the sale and purchasing your ticket at the same time. You will know immediately, in real time, whether you have guaranteed access to tickets or not. If you do, you will have 24 hours to purchase your ticket(s).\n\nThe details: OMG Registration is from July 27 at 12 pm noon, PDT through July 29 at 12 pm noon, PDT. You must be registered to participate in the OMG sale. There is no limit to the number of people who can register for the sale. Anyone with a complete Burner Profile (who hasn’t already bought a ticket in a previous a sale this year) can register anytime during the registration period.\n\nWhen registration opens, you’ll have 48 no-stress hours to log into your Burner Profile to register for the sale by clicking on the Register button on the right side of your Profile page.\n\nTickets go on sale Wednesday, Aug. 3 at 12 pm noon, PDT.\n\nOn the day of the sale, log in to your Burner Profile a bit ahead of time and make sure all of your information is accurate (including email and mailing addresses) Note: do not go to the Ticketfly website. You must go to Burner Profiles (profiles.burningman.org).\n\nBy 11:55 am PDT, you should be logged into your Burner Profile and ready for the sale to begin. There will be a countdown clock. At exactly noon, the timer will be replaced with a button that says “ENTER OMG SALE”. Click the button!\n\nThose who get tickets (determined by first-come, first-served in the order that people click the button) will see an immediate status of “You’re IN!” (and a link to purchase — note: You don’t have to purchase right away!). If you don’t make it in to the sale, you will receive a message that says “There are no more OMG tickets available.” Either way, you will know in real time if you are getting tickets. You will have the option of buying one or two tickets, and the option to buy a single vehicle pass.\n\nYou’ll have 24 hours to complete your purchase, so there’s no rush if you need to wait a bit. (You will also be sent an email soon after you get in with your link to buy tickets. It’s the same link that shows up right away in your Burner Profile). Your purchase must be completed by 12 pm (noon) PDT Thursday, Aug. 4.\n\nWe’ve heard your frustrations from past ticket sales, and we’re taking steps to address them. We believe this new process greatly improves fairness and gets us as close as possible to a “first-come, first-served” system.\n\nIf you are not among those who get tickets via OMG, don’t give up hope. Every year hundreds of tickets surface in the weeks leading up to the event.\n\nIf you have any questions about ticket stuff, visit the Ticket Support website.\n\nTop photo: Burner talks to the G in OMG.
