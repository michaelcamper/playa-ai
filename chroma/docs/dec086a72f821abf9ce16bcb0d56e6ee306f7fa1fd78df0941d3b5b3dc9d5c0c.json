Let’s go to Burning Man and party down with Recycle Camp!\n\nIf you’ve never crushed cans at Recycle Camp, you’ve never Burned. The Blue Duck, an incredible mechanical pedal-powered can-munching machine, fills the air with sounds of rattling metal and hoots of joy as can after can flies into its mighty gullet. Meanwhile, a stalwart crew of environmentally-motivated hecklers keep the music and the aluminum flowing, with only two goals in mind: Get More Cans and Have More Fun.\n\nSo why the cans? Because cans = cash, and in this case, the proceeds go directly to the Gerlach schools. For the past three years, that’s been a donation of around $1,500 to the community that so graciously hosts all our Burning Man shenanigans.\n\nRecycle Camp was founded by participants in the mid-1990s, and became an official Burning Man camp in 1998. In 2001, a young punk we call Mr. Blue arrived in Black Rock City and spent his week crushing cans, and the next year he took over the project. Ever since its inception, Recycle Camp has attracted truly fun, smart and dedicated team members, and Blue is the prime example — a good friend of mine, and a committed environmentalist who’s done incredible work to keep Burning Man dedicated to its Leave No Trace ethic.\n\nBut enough about Blue, how about YOU? How can you get in on the can-crushin’ hoedown? Easy. It’s located at 6:00 on the Center Camp ring, directly behind the Cafe, and open Monday through Sunday from 9am to 5pm. Throw all your cans, your neighbors’ cans and your nearest theme camp’s cans into a wagon, cart it down and get to crushing!\n\nAnd if I haven’t made it clear: Recycle Camp accepts ONLY ALUMINUM. For the rest — glass, plastic, cardboard, bicycles, trash and more — there is EXTRA.\n\nSee you at Recycle Camp, see you at the Burn!\n\nIt’s almost time to head to our dusty desert home, so we’ve got just one more edition of The Burner’s Guide to Leaving No Trace. Tune in soon for MOOP 101!",
