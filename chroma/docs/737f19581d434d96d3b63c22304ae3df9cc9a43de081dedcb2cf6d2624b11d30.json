  "content": "Last year I discovered—sadly, reluctantly—that so far, at this state of its technology and culture, VR feels nothing even remotely like Burning Man for me.\n\nSo instead I turned the small backyard of my apartment building into a theme camp, and invited anyone who wanted to come over—close friends, vague acquaintances, and even complete strangers—to visit and participate in a socially distanced art ritual I designed for the space. A new Burning Man type of art experience that anyone could come and try over the course of the week.\n\nIt was profoundly moving. It felt more like Burning Man than I’d imagined it possibly could. This year I’ll be doing it again, only with a completely different experience.\n\nIf you are gonna be in the San Francisco Bay Area between Saturday, August 28th, and Monday, September 6th, and would like to visit my theme camp and participate in a strange art experience, contact me: Caveat@burningman.org\n\nYou are most welcome—I look forward to seeing you!",
