  "content": "A few days after returning home from the playa for the first time, my friend Jen wrote a recap that was pure poetry. “For the last 20 years I have wanted to go to Burning Man, but never seemed to make it there,” she said. “I knew there would be elements that I would love (art! dancing! community!) but after many warnings about how hard it was, I remained open to *not* having a good experience. I went in with an open mind, even to Burning Man not being for me. But guess what? If you couldn’t tell, I loved it.” She went on to describe her time in BRC in profound and honest terms; it was almost as satisfying to read it as it was living it with her.\n\nInspired, we asked others in the community to share their first-time reflections with us. Forty people from around the world did just that: some writing full-on tales of adventure (to be published, perhaps, at another time), while others were more succinct in their impressions. Ninety-five percent of the entries were extremely positive; negative feedback focused things like camp commodification and other perceived violations of the 10 Principles. Common themes emerged in the responses, as you’ll see below, but within that each story is wholly its own.\n\nHere are some poignant and illuminating excerpts from what you sent in:\n\nWelcome Home — the Light Bulb Moment\n\nLove and Ambivalence for Playa Landmarks\n\nA Time of Great Personal Growth\n\n“It Set Me Free”\n\nDamn Dust!\n\nInterlude: A Poem\n\nThe mind is alterable\nIntense self consciousness becomes acute self awareness\nCertain phrases and thoughts can’t always be contained by my own brain\nThe mind is alterable\nThe radical self\nThere is only you\nIf the mind is alterable\nAnd the mind is the universe\nThe universe is infinitely dynamic\nHow you choose to expand your universe is only for you to decide\nThe mind is alterable\nDo not squander the mind, it is infinite power\n\nThe Spectacle of It All\n\nHow Will I Describe This to the People at Home?!\n\nPledges for Next Time / Suggestion Box\n\nIt Was Both Meh…\n\n…and Magic",
