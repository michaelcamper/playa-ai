  "content": "Something very interesting is happening in this stressful year of 2020. Our makers and gifters have been working overtime to produce gift items for Burning Man 2020, a year in which the event could not take place physically on the playa. But how can they gift these items to other Burners when we’re not all together in Black Rock City? The answer can be found in various online gifting groups coupled with the good old US Postal Service. Many of us who are sheltering in place or working from home are familiar with mail delivery quite often being the highlight of the day.\n\nIn addition to gifting, the usually frowned-upon method of bartering is also happening. Since on-playa gifting and receiving isn’t possible, makers are posting their latest creations online where others can request an item or offer up a trade for one of their own creations. We all know that gifting doesn’t seek anything in return; however, considering the bizarre circumstances of 2020, gifting and bartering via the USPS is making many people very happy in these times of social isolation. One gifter says, “I can’t tell you how many people I’ve gifted who have told me that this group and the generosity of spirit, care, creativity and fun have been a lifeline for them in this incredibly difficult year.”\n\nMany patches and stickers feature amusing references to Covid-19, including images of the viral particle and various curses directed its way. We’re seeing tickets to nowhere, driving passes good only in the Multiverse, and, of course, “it was better next year.” Jewelry makers haven’t expressed the loss of the event, but have gone with more classic themes such as the Man’s head, city map, and the Multiverse.\n\nIn true Burner style, our makers have created, from loss, an opportunity to carry on creating playa swag despite the difficult circumstances of 2020. The spirit of gifting is stronger than ever, and the generosity and creativity of our community are flourishing despite challenging obstacles. Gifting groups are helping keep us all connected and lift our spirits as we experience our first year without Black Rock City. The irrepressible Burning Man spirit is unstoppable!\n\nPatches from makers in the global Burning Man community\n\nStickers from makers in the global Burning Man community\n\nEnormous thanks and appreciation to all the makers for this diverse and clever burst of gifting creativity!",
