  "content": "The Sunset Piano project began with a spontaneous, D.I.Y. initiative of putting a piano (or two, or three, or twelve, as it ended up being) along the coast of California, just to see who would show up and play them. This renegade installation brought people together in appreciation of music and nature.\n\nLast year, Burning Man Arts’ Civic Arts program collaborated with the San Francisco Office of Workforce and Development (OWED) and artists Mauro ffortissimo and Dean Mermell to bring their roving Sunset Piano project to the streets of downtown San Francisco. And now this successful project has been extended for another year!\n\nPlease join us for the first event in the project’s latest series of events, Sunset Piano Opus IV. This debut event for Opus IV will take place at San Francisco’s Botanical Gardens. How beautiful! Come play some pianos or just enjoy some live music in one of San Francisco’s loveliest settings.\n\nWe here at Burning Man Arts believe that art and music belongs to everyone, regardless of access to traditional venues, and that equal access to art breaks down our sense of separation, of otherness, difference, estrangement, and disconnection. A simple act of putting art in a public space is actually a revolutionary act that challenges the cultural artifices of difference.\n\nFlower Piano\n\nSan Francisco Botanical Garden\nNinth Ave @ Lincoln Way\nSan Francisco, California 94122\n\nMembers: FREE\nSan Francisco Residents: FREE with proof of residency\nThe Garden is free to all daily 7:30-9am and all day on second Tuesdays of the month\nNon-residents:\n$7 general,\n$5 youth 12-17 & seniors\n$2 children 5-11; children 4 and under FREE\nfamilies of 2 adults and one or more child pay just $15\n\nVisit the event’s Facebook page or San Francisco Botanical Garden’s website for more information.
