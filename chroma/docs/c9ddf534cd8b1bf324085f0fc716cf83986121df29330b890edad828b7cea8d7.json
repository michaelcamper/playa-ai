Thank you!\n\nFree Talk by Larry Harvey\nand\nThe Convectional Caucus\n\nThis is a free, private event.  If you wish to attend, you must RSVP to: caucus-rsvp@burningman.com\n\nJoin us for this very special event!  This social mixer is a rare opportunity to meet the visiting 100+ Regional Contacts and community leaders from all over the world! They will be in town to participate in the 4th Annual Regional Leadership Summit. Designed to strengthen and spread Burning Man’s culture, the Summit is an opportunity for the visiting Regionals to learn from one another and to be inspired by the Bay Area Burning Man community.\n\nOn display will be a cross-section of our cultural fabric from around the Bay Area. Community organizations, Burning Man departments, related non-profits, and art groups will be on hand to share their missions and goals for the future. They will be displaying materials expressive of their methodology for both Regionals and you to absorb and take home, inspiring growth in world-wide Burner culture and events.\n\nAt approximately 6:30pm, Larry Harvey will speak, addressing these issues as well as the future of Burning Man’s culture and community in this ever-changing world.  This is his first talk in the Bay Area in several years and is not to be missed.\n\nWe hope you’ll join us on the 5th to learn and share what you know. Help us take a monumental step into the future of our global culture!\n\nThis is a free and private event.",
