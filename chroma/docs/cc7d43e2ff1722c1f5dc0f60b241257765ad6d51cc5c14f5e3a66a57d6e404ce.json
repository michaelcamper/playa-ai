  "content": "Following a blustery day of spotty power outages across the county, Seattle Burners spent Saturday night under clear skies at their local Decompression event.\n\nThis is the annual fundraiser for the non-profit Ignition Northwest arts organization in Seattle. The funds fuel art grants and support of the arts community, including an annual scholarship to the Pratt Fine Arts Center.\n\nBelow is a short photo essay of this event. Click here to see the whole set.\n\nThe event ran for nine fun-filled hours, thanks to Daylight Savings Time ending. Perplexed riders on the light rail station above the event wondered at the fires and lights, even as the participants below played, danced, or explored the many art pieces and demonstrations offered at the event.",
