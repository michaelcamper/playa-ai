  "content": "Burning Man is so much more than a week in the dust. Our nonprofit organization spends the other 51 weeks sharing the 10 Principles, supporting community initiatives, funding artists, and elevating Burning Man culture. Each year we produce an Annual Report to share the highlights of what we learned and achieved. Here is a collection of some of the most meaningful stories from around the Burning world in 2019. In a year without our beloved city in the desert, it feels like a treasured opportunity to look back on everything we collectively accomplished last year.\n\nRead on as our CEO Marian Goodell introduces Burning Man Project’s 2019 Annual Report.\n\nWelcome!\n\n2019 was a year of metamorphoses for Burning Man Project and Burning Man’s global community of dreamers and doers. A few highlights:\n\n• Today there are more than 100 annual Burning Man events and 40 Burners Without Borders chapters on six continents.\n\n• In 2019 we granted more than $1.4 million through our Honoraria, Global Art Grant, and Community Grant programs.\n\n• The 3,800-acre Fly Ranch now serves as a year-round incubator for Burning Man culture; more than 2,000 visitors from around the world attended 20 camping events and 70 nature walks on the property this year.\n\nWe’ve also taken initial steps to transform our environmental impact. Informed by our stewardship of the land and waters at Fly Ranch and the global climate crisis, we created an environmental sustainability roadmap that sets ambitious goals around waste management, ecological impact, and carbon sequestration.\n\nThis year the desert once again gave rise to a thriving, transformative, and playful Black Rock City. Buoyed by support from participants, our global community, and our board of directors, we doubled down on our efforts to strengthen Burning Man culture by recommitting to our Principles and resisting commodification. In a major win for our entire community, our playa restoration efforts in 2019 excelled beyond all measure. We left the playa in what Bureau of Land Management inspectors called “immaculate” condition.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020, we are inspired by what’s on the horizon. We are committed to widening and deepening our network of partnerships and collaborations, laying down new pathways for connections to take root, new ideas to surface, and social impact projects to succeed. Convenings, like Esalen and others, contribute to fulfilling these objectives, and we plan to place new focus on growing this aspect of our annual program.\n\nAs we move into the future, we are inspired by our dear founder Larry Harvey’s legacy and vision, including his ambition to see Burning Man culture flourish “on every street corner.”\n\nThank you for your curiosity, your engagement, and your contributions that fuel Burning Man. In the following pages you will meet a few of the people and programs made possible through your participation and support. Together, we are creating a more generous, creative, and collaborative world. We couldn’t do this important work without you.\n\nIn Gratitude,\n\nMarian Goodell\n\nCEO, Burning Man Project\n\nHeader design by Tanner Boeger",
