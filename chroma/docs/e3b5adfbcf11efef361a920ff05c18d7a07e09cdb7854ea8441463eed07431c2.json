  "content": "What follows is a short photo essay of last night’s Early Burn. These photos and captions are from Todd “portaplaya” Gardiner, who will be working with some of the bloggers here during the event this year.\n\nportaplaya writes\n\nMany of these works were rigged with fireworks, adding an explosive punch to the celebration.\n\nFireworks shot overhead and fires roared as the crowd surged left and right to the most recent ignition. Daredevils lit their projects once their neighbors confirmed that their pyro is spent. Roman candles were passed out and people take aim at the sculptures while others with cameras shot photos and video.\n\nAfterward, the crowd lingered, sharing beers and whiskey. Some depart for bars or parties set up in their work camps. Others stay here watching the embers. It was a late night for most. But work started up again the next day. Later than normal, of course.\n\n-portaplaya",
