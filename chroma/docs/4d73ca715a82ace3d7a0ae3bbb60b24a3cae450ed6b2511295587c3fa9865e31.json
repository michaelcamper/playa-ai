A group of 35 attendees from this year’s Global Leadership Conference participated by reading, discussing and finally voting on which grant proposals would receive funding. We are happy to announce that this year $3,000 was awarded to three civic art and two civic engagement projects.\n\nThe following civic engagement projects were awarded grants:\n\nThe following art projects were awarded grants:\n\nThe Walk the Talk Grant Program is a timely reminder to GLC participants as they wrap up four days of skill sharing and relationship building to turn their connections and conversations into action.\n\nThe Civic Grant aims to fund programs that create collaborations, produce direct actions, utilize the 10 Principles of Burning Man, are reproducible, and creatively tackle local problems.\n\nThe Art Grant is for projects that create collaborations, break down the distinction between audience and artist, are directly interactive and/or enhance the public, civic sphere.\n\nThe unique process is something to talk about too. Instead of using a more traditional panel model to judge applicants, Christopher Breedlove, program manager for Burners Without Borders, has developed a more collaborative process.\n\n“I’m really into democratic granting processes because I believe that the community can decide better where the ultimate value our money should be going than any type of judging council,” he says. “The community is just super big, and I’m interested in what they would choose.”\n\nEach grant proposal is surveyed by small groups of two or three and then, after reading their particular application, all the groups come back together to share what project they examined, and everyone narrows down the list by sharing thoughts, suggestions and questions.\n\n“We usually end up with a big ‘needs more development’ pile and a big ‘yes’ pile,” Christopher says, “and that’s where the deeper and richer conversation comes from: What is going to add the most value and what is going to have the most impact?”\n\nIf you are interested to propose a civic engagement project for Burners Without Borders, their community micro-grant program just opened up and you can submit your proposals by June 1 here.\n\nCongratulations to all the grant recipients and thank you to the GLC attendees who participated in this years Walk The Talk Community Grant Salon!",
