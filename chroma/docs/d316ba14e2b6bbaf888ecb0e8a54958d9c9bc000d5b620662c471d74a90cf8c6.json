  "content": "During the past 25 years, Burning Man has had a profound cultural and economic impact on Reno and the surrounding area. Burning Man culture, and Burners themselves, were not embraced by Northern Nevada in the early years, with dusty travelers, unusual rigs, and strange outfits typically unwelcomed by businesses and locals. That has changed!\n\nAnd the art! Art from the playa can be seen temporarily and permanently displayed in Reno and other Nevada cities, including Fernley and Carson City. These beautiful pieces feature prominently in Reno’s creative landscape and reflect just how deeply the Biggest Little City is influenced by Burning Man, and in turn how that translates into Reno’s cultural impact on its citizens and tourists.\n\nNorthern Nevada is not the only trailblazer. Oakland, San Leandro, San Jose, and Las Vegas have all worked with Burning Man and Burning Man artists to display art cars and place public art initially installed on the playa. Where once good Nevada citizens kept secret their journey to Black Rock City, elected officials and business leaders now embrace our principles and our spirit.\n\nBurning Man’s annual economic impact on Nevada is conservatively estimated at $60 million: approximately $50 million from participants and $10 million from the Burning Man organization. Many businesses — hotels, grocers, costume shops, ice distributors, RV dealers, box and home improvement stores, auto repair experts, and car washes — plan their year around the event and compete for Burners’ business. Entrepreneurial sole proprietors and major corporations both benefit. Whole Foods and Save Mart run successful recycling and trash programs post-event to encourage returning Burners to shop at their stores.\n\nElon Musk went to Burning Man, and now there is a massive, state of the art Tesla gigafactory near Reno and electric vehicle charging station in Lovelock. Musk’s cousin, Lyndon Rive, accompanied him to Black Rock City and was inspired to start Solar City. Sergey Brin and Larry Page went to Burning Man in 1998 and left a discreet message to their friends and colleagues by creating the first ever Google Doodle. Time in Black Rock City translates to real, impactful innovation. Time on the playa surrounded by people both connected — to time, place, and community — and disconnected — from outside schedules and devices — affords creative minds the freedom to explore and question.\n\nBehind the scenes, Burning Man meets year round with elected officials and government agencies to plan and permit the event. Where once we had minimal contact with officials, we now coordinate closely with more than a dozen local, state, tribal, and federal agencies to ensure smooth operations and public safety. We routinely meet with members of Congress to keep them apprised of issues that may be important to their constituents. We spend close to $5 million just on permits and contracts with law enforcement. Our impact continues to grow.\n\nAs a proud Nevadan for 20 years and 17-year Burner, I can say I’ve watched with amazement and pride as Burning Man and Reno have evolved and intertwined. It’s been fun and rewarding to see those changes spread to other cities and communities in Northern Nevada. It’s a lot like the personal journey so many of us embark on after going to Burning Man for the first time. First we wear different outfits back home and color our hair. Then we volunteer for an art project or organize a Theme Camp. Next thing we know, we’ve left our jobs and started a new career, inspired by the wonderful culture and values we’ve chosen to embrace. I’m very much looking forward to being a part of the next phase in Burning Man’s journey with the Silver State.\n\nTop photo: Guardian of Eden by Kate Raudenbush (Photo by Bill Kositsky)",
