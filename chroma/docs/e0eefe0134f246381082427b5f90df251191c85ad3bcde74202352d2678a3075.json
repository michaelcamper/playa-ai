  "content": "We display them proudly, like badges of playa honor — slapping them on dusty kanteens & sunworn bumpers … emblems of a Burn well prepped & memories earned, of a community gloriously grounded in Gifting.\n\nEach year, we invite YOU, the citizens of Black Rock City, to design stickers for what will become our Gate (welcome) sticker — handed out by Greeters at the entrance of the city and accompanied by the WhatWhereWhen booklet — along with a handful of other selected sticker designs which we print like bunnies for rabid Gifting throughout the week.\n\nIf you’ve ever stepped foot on the hallowed dusty ground of Black Rock City, you’ve undoubtedly departed with (at least) a favorite sticker … or 20. You love to collect them, we love to print them — it’s a match made in playa heaven. From the absurdly abstract to the maniacally mundane and curiously crusty — there’s a Burning Man sticker for everyone, and we want to see YOURS!\n\nNow it’s time to read all the ins & outs (listed below) about how to submit your 2024 Black Rock City sticker design(s) for consideration. Most importantly, let your imagination run wild — or, in this case, run “Curiouser & Curiouser” — we can’t wait to see what you come up with! Oh, and please (PLEASE) read the submission requirements carefully, it’ll save us both a lot of unnecessary time and headaches.\n\nYOUR 2024 STICKER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\n\nPro Tip #1: Check yo’ specs. Then, go back and carefully re-check ‘em (above) again!\n\nPro Tip #2: You snooze, you lose — don’t miss the May 24th deadline for consideration of your badass design(s).\n\nWe may be a decommodified city where cash is out, but stickers are always in. Because you can take the Burning Man out of stickers, but you can’t take the stickers out of Burning Man!\n\nSo get busy designing, and may the dust bunnies be ever in your favor. Selected sticker designs will be contacted via email. Good luck — may your designs take you to Curiouser & Curiouser places.",
